**Medicine** is the [science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science "Science")<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> and [practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praxis_(process) "Praxis (process)")<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> of caring for a patient, managing the [diagnosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis "Diagnosis"), [prognosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis "Prognosis"), [prevention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine "Preventive medicine"), [treatment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy "Therapy"), [palliation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palliative_care "Palliative care") of their [injury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury "Injury") or [disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease "Disease"), and [promoting their health](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_promotion "Health promotion"). Medicine encompasses a variety of [health care](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care "Health care") practices evolved to maintain and restore [health](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health "Health") by the [prevention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevention_(medical) "Prevention (medical)") and treatment of [illness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness "Illness"). Contemporary medicine applies [biomedical sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomedical_sciences "Biomedical sciences"), [biomedical research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomedical_research "Biomedical research"), [genetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_genetics "Medical genetics"), and [medical technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_technology "Medical technology") to [diagnose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis_(medical) "Diagnosis (medical)"), treat, and prevent injury and disease, typically through [pharmaceuticals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical "Pharmaceutical") or [surgery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery "Surgery"), but also through therapies as diverse as [psychotherapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy "Psychotherapy"), [external splints and traction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splint_(medicine) "Splint (medicine)"), [medical devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_device "Medical device"), [biologics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biologic_medical_product "Biologic medical product"), and [ionizing radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_(medicine) "Radiation (medicine)"), amongst others.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>

Medicine has been practiced since [prehistoric times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prehistoric_medicine "Prehistoric medicine"), and for most of this time it was an [art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art "Art") (an area of creativity and skill), frequently having connections to the [religious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion "Religion") and [philosophical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy "Philosophy") beliefs of local culture. For example, a [medicine man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine_man "Medicine man") would apply [herbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbs "Herbs") and say [prayers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prayer "Prayer") for healing, or an ancient [philosopher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosopher "Philosopher") and [physician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician "Physician") would apply [bloodletting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloodletting "Bloodletting") according to the theories of [humorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humorism "Humorism"). In recent centuries, since the [advent of modern science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_science "History of science"), most medicine has become a combination of art and science (both [basic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_science "Fundamental science") and [applied](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_science "Applied science"), under the [umbrella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbrella_term "Umbrella term") of **medical science**). For example, while stitching technique for [sutures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture "Surgical suture") is an art learned through practice, knowledge of what happens at the [cellular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytology "Cytology") and [molecular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_medicine "Molecular medicine") level in the tissues being stitched arises through science.

Prescientific forms of medicine, now known as [traditional medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_medicine "Traditional medicine") or _folk medicine_, remain commonly used in the absence of scientific medicine and are thus called [alternative medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine "Alternative medicine"). Alternative treatments outside of scientific medicine with ethical, safety and efficacy concerns are termed [quackery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quackery "Quackery").

## Clinical practice\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Medicine&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Clinical practice")\]

[![Oil painting of medicine in the age of colonialism](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/The_Doctor_Luke_Fildes_crop.jpg/240px-The_Doctor_Luke_Fildes_crop.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_Doctor_Luke_Fildes_crop.jpg)

_The Doctor_ by [Sir Luke Fildes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Luke_Fildes "Sir Luke Fildes") (1891)

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Elizabeth_Blackwell.jpg/220px-Elizabeth_Blackwell.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Elizabeth_Blackwell.jpg)

[Elizabeth Blackwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Blackwell "Elizabeth Blackwell"), the first female physician in the United States graduated from [SUNY Upstate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_University_of_New_York_Upstate_Medical_University "State University of New York Upstate Medical University") (1847)

Medical availability and clinical practice vary across the world due to regional differences in [culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture "Culture") and [technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology "Technology"). Modern scientific medicine is highly developed in the [Western world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world "Western world"), while in [developing countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country "Developing country") such as parts of Africa or Asia, the population may rely more heavily on [traditional medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_medicine "Traditional medicine") with limited evidence and efficacy and no required formal training for practitioners.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup>

In the [developed world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_country "Developed country"), [evidence-based medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine "Evidence-based medicine") is not universally used in clinical practice; for example, a 2007 survey of literature reviews found that about 49% of the interventions lacked sufficient evidence to support either benefit or harm.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup>

In modern clinical practice, [physicians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicians "Physicians") and [physician assistants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician_assistants "Physician assistants") personally assess patients to [diagnose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis "Medical diagnosis"), prognose, treat, and prevent disease using clinical judgment. The [doctor-patient relationship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor-patient_relationship "Doctor-patient relationship") typically begins with an interaction with an examination of the patient's [medical history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_history "Medical history") and [medical record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record "Medical record"), followed by a medical interview<sup id="cite_ref-Coulehan_2005_10-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine#cite_note-Coulehan_2005-10">[10]</a></sup> and a [physical examination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination "Physical examination"). Basic diagnostic [medical devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_device "Medical device") (e.g., [stethoscope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stethoscope "Stethoscope"), [tongue depressor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongue_depressor "Tongue depressor")) are typically used. After examining for [signs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign "Medical sign") and interviewing for [symptoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptoms "Symptoms"), the doctor may order [medical tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_test "Medical test") (e.g., [blood tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test "Blood test")), take a [biopsy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy "Biopsy"), or prescribe [pharmaceutical drugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug "Pharmaceutical drug") or other therapies. [Differential diagnosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis "Differential diagnosis") methods help to rule out conditions based on the information provided. During the encounter, properly informing the patient of all relevant facts is an important part of the relationship and the development of trust. The medical encounter is then documented in the medical record, which is a legal document in many jurisdictions.<sup id="cite_ref-AHIMA2005_11-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine#cite_note-AHIMA2005-11">[11]</a></sup> Follow-ups may be shorter but follow the same general procedure, and specialists follow a similar process. The diagnosis and treatment may take only a few minutes or a few weeks, depending on the complexity of the issue.

The components of the medical interview<sup id="cite_ref-Coulehan_2005_10-1" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine#cite_note-Coulehan_2005-10">[10]</a></sup> and encounter are:

- Chief complaint (CC): the reason for the current medical visit. These are the _[symptoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom "Symptom")_. They are in the patient's own words and are recorded along with the duration of each one. Also called _chief concern_ or _presenting complaint_.
- Current activity: occupation, hobbies, what the patient actually does.
- [Family history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_history_(medicine) "Family history (medicine)") (FH): listing of diseases in the family that may impact the patient. A [family tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_tree "Family tree") is sometimes used.
- History of present [illness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness "Illness") (HPI): the chronological order of events of symptoms and further clarification of each symptom. Distinguishable from history of previous illness, often called past medical history (PMH). [Medical history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_history "Medical history") comprises HPI and PMH.
- [Medications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication "Medication") (Rx): what drugs the patient takes including [prescribed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription "Medical prescription"), [over-the-counter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over-the-counter_drug "Over-the-counter drug"), and [home remedies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_remedy "Home remedy"), as well as alternative and [herbal medicines or remedies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbalism "Herbalism"). [Allergies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy "Allergy") are also recorded.
- Past medical history (PMH/PMHx): concurrent medical problems, past hospitalizations and operations, injuries, past [infectious diseases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease "Infectious disease") or [vaccinations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination "Vaccination"), history of known allergies.
- Review of systems (ROS) or _systems inquiry_: a set of additional questions to ask, which may be missed on HPI: a general enquiry (have you noticed any [weight loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss "Weight loss"), change in sleep quality, fevers, lumps and bumps? etc.), followed by questions on the body's main organ systems ([heart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_heart "Human heart"), [lungs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_lung "Human lung"), [digestive tract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestive_tract "Digestive tract"), [urinary tract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system "Urinary system"), etc.).
- Social history (SH): birthplace, residences, marital history, social and economic status, habits (including [diet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition) "Diet (nutrition)"), medications, [tobacco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking "Tobacco smoking"), alcohol).

The physical examination is the examination of the patient for medical signs of disease that are objective and observable, in contrast to symptoms that are volunteered by the patient and are not necessarily objectively observable.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> The healthcare provider uses sight, hearing, touch, and sometimes smell (e.g., in infection, [uremia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uremia "Uremia"), [diabetic ketoacidosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_ketoacidosis "Diabetic ketoacidosis")). Four actions are the basis of physical examination: [inspection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inspection_(medicine) "Inspection (medicine)"), [palpation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palpation "Palpation") (feel), [percussion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percussion_(medicine) "Percussion (medicine)") (tap to determine resonance characteristics), and [auscultation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auscultation "Auscultation") (listen), generally in that order, although auscultation occurs prior to percussion and palpation for abdominal assessments.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup>

The clinical examination involves the study of:<sup id="cite_ref-auto1_14-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine#cite_note-auto1-14">[14]</a></sup>

- [Abdomen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen "Abdomen") and [rectum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum "Rectum")
- [Cardiovascular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular "Cardiovascular") ([heart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart "Heart") and [blood vessels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel "Blood vessel"))
- General appearance of the patient and specific indicators of disease (nutritional status, presence of jaundice, pallor or [clubbing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nail_clubbing "Nail clubbing"))
- Genitalia (and pregnancy if the patient is or could be pregnant)
- Head, [eye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye "Eye"), [ear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear "Ear"), nose, and throat ([HEENT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HEENT_examination "HEENT examination"))<sup id="cite_ref-auto1_14-1" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine#cite_note-auto1-14">[14]</a></sup>

- [Psychiatric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry "Psychiatry") (orientation, [mental state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_state_examination "Mental state examination"), mood, evidence of abnormal perception or thought).
- [Respiratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory "Respiratory") (large airways and [lungs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_lung "Human lung"))<sup id="cite_ref-auto1_14-2" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine#cite_note-auto1-14">[14]</a></sup>

It is to likely focus on areas of interest highlighted in the medical history and may not include everything listed above.

The treatment plan may include ordering additional [medical laboratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_laboratory "Medical laboratory") tests and [medical imaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging "Medical imaging") studies, starting therapy, referral to a [specialist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_specialty "Medical specialty"), or watchful observation. A follow-up may be advised. Depending upon the [health insurance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance "Health insurance") plan and the [managed care](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Managed_care "Managed care") system, various forms of "[utilization review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilization_review "Utilization review")", such as prior authorization of tests, may place barriers on accessing expensive services.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup>

The medical decision-making (MDM) process includes the analysis and synthesis of all the above data to come up with a list of possible diagnoses (the differential diagnoses), along with an idea of what needs to be done to obtain a definitive diagnosis that would explain the patient's problem.

On subsequent visits, the process may be repeated in an abbreviated manner to obtain any new history, symptoms, physical findings, lab or imaging results, or specialist [consultations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consultation_(doctor) "Consultation (doctor)").

## Institutions\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Medicine&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Institutions")\]

Contemporary medicine is, in general, conducted within [health care systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_system "Health care system"). Legal, [credentialing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credential "Credential"), and financing frameworks are established by individual governments, augmented on occasion by international organizations, such as churches. The characteristics of any given health care system have a significant impact on the way medical care is provided.

From ancient times, Christian emphasis on practical charity gave rise to the development of systematic nursing and hospitals, and the [Catholic Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church "Catholic Church") today remains the largest non-government provider of medical services in the world.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup> Advanced industrial countries (with the exception of the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States"))<sup id="cite_ref-IOM_17-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine#cite_note-IOM-17">[17]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-ccuhc_18-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine#cite_note-ccuhc-18">[18]</a></sup> and many developing countries provide medical services through a system of [universal health care](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_health_care "Universal health care") that aims to guarantee care for all through a [single-payer health care](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-payer_health_care "Single-payer health care") system or compulsory private or cooperative health insurance. This is intended to ensure that the entire population has access to medical care on the basis of need rather than ability to pay. Delivery may be via private medical practices, state-owned hospitals and clinics, or charities, most commonly a combination of all three.

Most [tribal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribe "Tribe") societies provide no guarantee of healthcare for the population as a whole. In such societies, healthcare is available to those who can afford to pay for it, have self-insured it (either directly or as part of an employment contract), or may be covered by care financed directly by the government or tribe.

Modern drug [ampoules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampoule "Ampoule")

Transparency of information is another factor defining a delivery system. Access to information on conditions, treatments, quality, and pricing greatly affects the choice of patients/consumers and, therefore, the incentives of medical professionals. While the US healthcare system has come under fire for its lack of openness,<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup> new legislation may encourage greater openness. There is a perceived tension between the need for transparency on the one hand and such issues as patient confidentiality and the possible exploitation of information for commercial gain on the other.

The [health professionals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_professional "Health professional") who provide care in medicine comprise multiple [professions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profession "Profession"), such as [medics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine "Doctor of Medicine"), [nurses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing "Nursing"), [physiotherapists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy "Physical therapy"), and [psychologists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychologist "Psychologist"). These professions will have their own [ethical standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_ethics "Professional ethics"), professional education, and bodies. The medical profession has been conceptualized from a [sociological perspective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sociology#The_Medical_Profession "Medical sociology").<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup>

[Primary care](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care "Primary care") medical services are provided by [physicians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician "Physician"), [physician assistants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician_assistant "Physician assistant"), [nurse practitioners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse_practitioner "Nurse practitioner"), or other health professionals who have first contact with a patient seeking medical treatment or care.<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup> These occur in physician offices, [clinics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic "Clinic"), [nursing homes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing_home "Nursing home"), schools, home visits, and other places close to patients. About 90% of medical visits can be treated by the primary care provider. These include treatment of acute and chronic illnesses, [preventive care](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_care "Preventive care") and [health education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_education "Health education") for all ages and both sexes.

[Secondary care](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_care "Secondary care") medical services are provided by [medical specialists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_specialist "Medical specialist") in their offices or clinics or at local community hospitals for a patient referred by a primary care provider who first diagnosed or treated the patient.<sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup> Referrals are made for those patients who required the expertise or procedures performed by specialists. These include both [ambulatory care](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulatory_care "Ambulatory care") and [inpatient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inpatient "Inpatient") services, [emergency departments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department "Emergency department"), [intensive care medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_medicine "Intensive care medicine"), surgery services, [physical therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy "Physical therapy"), [labor and delivery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth "Childbirth"), [endoscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy "Endoscopy") units, diagnostic laboratory and medical imaging services, [hospice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospice_care "Hospice care") centers, etc. Some primary care providers may also take care of hospitalized patients and deliver babies in a secondary care setting.

[Tertiary care](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_care "Tertiary care") medical services are provided by specialist hospitals or regional centers equipped with diagnostic and treatment facilities not generally available at local hospitals. These include [trauma centers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_center "Trauma center"), [burn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn_(injury) "Burn (injury)") treatment centers, advanced [neonatology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonatology "Neonatology") unit services, [organ transplants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplant "Organ transplant"), high-risk pregnancy, [radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy "Radiation therapy") [oncology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology "Oncology"), etc.

Modern medical care also depends on information – still delivered in many health care settings on paper records, but increasingly nowadays by [electronic means](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_health_record "Electronic health record").

In low-income countries, modern healthcare is often too expensive for the average person. International healthcare policy researchers have advocated that "user fees" be removed in these areas to ensure access, although even after removal, significant costs and barriers remain.<sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup>

[Separation of prescribing and dispensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_prescribing_and_dispensing "Separation of prescribing and dispensing") is a practice in medicine and pharmacy in which the physician who provides a [medical prescription](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription "Medical prescription") is independent from the [pharmacist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacist "Pharmacist") who provides the [prescription drug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescription_drug "Prescription drug"). In the Western world there are centuries of tradition for separating pharmacists from physicians. In Asian countries, it is traditional for physicians to also provide drugs.<sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup>

Working together as an [interdisciplinary team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdisciplinary_team "Interdisciplinary team"), many highly trained [health professionals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_profession "Health profession") besides medical practitioners are involved in the delivery of modern health care. Examples include: [nurses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse "Nurse"), [emergency medical technicians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medical_technician "Emergency medical technician") and [paramedics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramedics "Paramedics"), laboratory scientists, [pharmacists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacists "Pharmacists"), [podiatrists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podiatry "Podiatry"), [physiotherapists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiotherapists "Physiotherapists"), [respiratory therapists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_therapists "Respiratory therapists"), [speech therapists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_therapy "Speech therapy"), [occupational therapists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_therapy "Occupational therapy"), radiographers, [dietitians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietitian "Dietitian"), and [bioengineers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioengineering "Bioengineering"), [medical physicists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_physics "Medical physics"), [surgeons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeons "Surgeons"), [surgeon's assistant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon%27s_assistant "Surgeon's assistant"), [surgical technologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_technologist "Surgical technologist").

The scope and sciences underpinning human medicine overlap many other fields. A patient admitted to the hospital is usually under the care of a specific team based on their main presenting problem, e.g., the cardiology team, who then may interact with other specialties, e.g., surgical, radiology, to help diagnose or treat the main problem or any subsequent complications/developments.

Physicians have many specializations and subspecializations into certain branches of medicine, which are listed below. There are variations from country to country regarding which specialties certain subspecialties are in.

The main branches of medicine are:

- Basic sciences of medicine; this is what every physician is educated in, and some return to in [biomedical research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomedical_research#Preclinical_research "Biomedical research").
- [Interdisciplinary fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdisciplinary_sub-specialties_of_medicine "Interdisciplinary sub-specialties of medicine"), where different medical specialties are mixed to function in certain occasions.
- [Medical specialties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_specialties "Medical specialties")

In the broadest meaning of "medicine", there are many different specialties. In the UK, most specialities have their own body or college, which has its own entrance examination. These are collectively known as the Royal Colleges, although not all currently use the term "Royal". The development of a speciality is often driven by new technology (such as the development of effective anaesthetics) or ways of working (such as emergency departments); the new specialty leads to the formation of a unifying body of doctors and the prestige of administering their own examination.

Within medical circles, specialities usually fit into one of two broad categories: "Medicine" and "Surgery". "Medicine" refers to the practice of non-operative medicine, and most of its subspecialties require preliminary training in Internal Medicine. In the UK, this was traditionally evidenced by passing the examination for the Membership of the [Royal College of Physicians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_College_of_Physicians "Royal College of Physicians") (MRCP) or the equivalent college in Scotland or Ireland. "Surgery" refers to the practice of operative medicine, and most subspecialties in this area require preliminary training in General Surgery, which in the UK leads to membership of the [Royal College of Surgeons of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_College_of_Surgeons_of_England "Royal College of Surgeons of England") (MRCS). At present, some specialties of medicine do not fit easily into either of these categories, such as radiology, pathology, or anesthesia. Most of these have branched from one or other of the two camps above; for example anaesthesia developed first as a [faculty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faculty_(teaching_staff) "Faculty (teaching staff)") of the Royal College of Surgeons (for which MRCS/FRCS would have been required) before becoming the [Royal College of Anaesthetists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_College_of_Anaesthetists "Royal College of Anaesthetists") and membership of the college is attained by sitting for the examination of the Fellowship of the Royal College of Anesthetists (FRCA).

#### Surgical specialty\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Medicine&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Surgical specialty")\]

Main article: [Surgery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery "Surgery")

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Surgeons_at_Work.jpg/220px-Surgeons_at_Work.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Surgeons_at_Work.jpg)

Surgeons in an [operating room](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_room "Operating room")

_Surgery_ is an ancient medical specialty that uses operative manual and instrumental techniques on a patient to investigate or treat a [pathological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathological "Pathological") condition such as disease or [injury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury "Injury"), to help improve bodily function or appearance or to repair unwanted ruptured areas (for example, [a perforated ear drum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perforated_eardrum "Perforated eardrum")). Surgeons must also manage pre-operative, post-operative, and potential surgical candidates on the hospital wards. In some centers, [anesthesiology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesiology "Anesthesiology") is part of the division of surgery (for historical and logistical reasons), although it is not a surgical discipline. Other medical specialties may employ surgical procedures, such as [ophthalmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology "Ophthalmology") and [dermatology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatology "Dermatology"), but are not considered surgical sub-specialties per se.

Surgical training in the U.S. requires a minimum of five years of residency after medical school. Sub-specialties of surgery often require seven or more years. In addition, fellowships can last an additional one to three years. Because post-residency fellowships can be competitive, many trainees devote two additional years to research. Thus in some cases surgical training will not finish until more than a decade after medical school. Furthermore, surgical training can be very difficult and time-consuming.

Surgical subspecialties include those a physician may specialize in after undergoing general surgery residency training as well as several surgical fields with separate residency training. Surgical subspecialties that one may pursue following general surgery residency training: _<sup id="cite_ref-auto_26-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine#cite_note-auto-26">[26]</a></sup>_

#### Internal medicine specialty\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Medicine&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Internal medicine specialty")\]

Main article: [Internal medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_medicine "Internal medicine")

**Internal medicine** is the [medical specialty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_specialty "Medical specialty") dealing with the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of adult diseases.<sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup> According to some sources, an emphasis on internal structures is implied.<sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup> In North America, specialists in internal medicine are commonly called "internists". Elsewhere, especially in [Commonwealth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations "Commonwealth of Nations") nations, such specialists are often called [physicians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician "Physician").<sup id="cite_ref-Fowler_29-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine#cite_note-Fowler-29">[29]</a></sup> These terms, _internist_ or _physician_ (in the narrow sense, common outside North America), generally exclude practitioners of gynecology and obstetrics, pathology, psychiatry, and especially surgery and its subspecialities.

Because their patients are often seriously ill or require complex investigations, internists do much of their work in hospitals. Formerly, many internists were not subspecialized; such _general physicians_ would see any complex nonsurgical problem; this style of practice has become much less common. In modern urban practice, most internists are subspecialists: that is, they generally limit their medical practice to problems of one organ system or to one particular area of medical knowledge. For example, [gastroenterologists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroenterology "Gastroenterology") and [nephrologists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrology "Nephrology") specialize respectively in diseases of the gut and the kidneys.<sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup>

In the Commonwealth of Nations and some other countries, specialist [pediatricians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics "Pediatrics") and [geriatricians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geriatrics "Geriatrics") are also described as _specialist physicians_ (or internists) who have subspecialized by age of patient rather than by organ system. Elsewhere, especially in North America, general pediatrics is often a form of [primary care](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care_physician "Primary care physician").

There are many subspecialities (or subdisciplines) of [internal medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_medicine "Internal medicine"):

Training in internal medicine (as opposed to surgical training), varies considerably across the world: see the articles on _[medical education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_education "Medical education")_ for more details. In North America, it requires at least three years of residency training after medical school, which can then be followed by a one- to three-year fellowship in the subspecialties listed above. In general, resident work hours in medicine are less than those in surgery, averaging about 60 hours per week in the US. This difference does not apply in the UK where all doctors are now required by law to work less than 48 hours per week on average.

#### Diagnostic specialties\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Medicine&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Diagnostic specialties")\]

- _[Clinical laboratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_laboratory "Clinical laboratory") sciences_ are the clinical diagnostic services that apply laboratory techniques to diagnosis and management of patients. In the United States, these services are supervised by a pathologist. The personnel that work in these [medical laboratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_laboratory "Medical laboratory") departments are technically trained staff who do not hold medical degrees, but who usually hold an undergraduate [medical technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_technology "Medical technology") degree, who actually perform the [tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_test "Medical test"), [assays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay "Assay"), and procedures needed for providing the specific services. Subspecialties include [transfusion medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfusion_medicine "Transfusion medicine"), [cellular pathology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_pathology "Cellular pathology"), [clinical chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_chemistry "Clinical chemistry"), [hematology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematology "Hematology"), [clinical microbiology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_microbiology "Clinical microbiology") and [clinical immunology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_immunology "Clinical immunology").
- _[Clinical neurophysiology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_neurophysiology "Clinical neurophysiology")_ is concerned with testing the physiology or function of the central and peripheral aspects of the nervous system. These kinds of tests can be divided into recordings of: (1) spontaneous or continuously running electrical activity, or (2) stimulus evoked responses. Subspecialties include [electroencephalography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography "Electroencephalography"), [electromyography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromyography "Electromyography"), [evoked potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evoked_potential "Evoked potential"), [nerve conduction study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_conduction_study "Nerve conduction study") and [polysomnography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysomnography "Polysomnography"). Sometimes these tests are performed by techs without a medical degree, but the interpretation of these tests is done by a medical professional.
- _Diagnostic [radiology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology "Radiology")_ is concerned with imaging of the body, e.g. by [x-rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray "X-ray"), x-ray [computed tomography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computed_tomography "Computed tomography"), [ultrasonography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasonography "Ultrasonography"), and [nuclear magnetic resonance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_magnetic_resonance "Nuclear magnetic resonance") [tomography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography "Tomography"). Interventional radiologists can access areas in the body under imaging for an intervention or diagnostic sampling.
- _[Nuclear medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_medicine "Nuclear medicine")_ is concerned with studying human organ systems by administering radiolabelled substances (radiopharmaceuticals) to the body, which can then be imaged outside the body by a [gamma camera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_camera "Gamma camera") or a PET scanner. Each radiopharmaceutical consists of two parts: a tracer that is specific for the function under study (e.g., neurotransmitter pathway, metabolic pathway, blood flow, or other), and a radionuclide (usually either a gamma-emitter or a positron emitter). There is a degree of overlap between nuclear medicine and radiology, as evidenced by the emergence of combined devices such as the PET/CT scanner.
- _[Pathology as a medical specialty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology_as_a_medical_specialty "Pathology as a medical specialty")_ is the branch of medicine that deals with the study of diseases and the morphologic, physiologic changes produced by them. As a diagnostic specialty, pathology can be considered the basis of modern scientific medical knowledge and plays a large role in [evidence-based medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine "Evidence-based medicine"). Many modern molecular tests such as [flow cytometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry "Flow cytometry"), [polymerase chain reaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction "Polymerase chain reaction") (PCR), [immunohistochemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry "Immunohistochemistry"), [cytogenetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytogenetics "Cytogenetics"), gene rearrangements studies and [fluorescent in situ hybridization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescent_in_situ_hybridization "Fluorescent in situ hybridization") (FISH) fall within the territory of pathology.

Medical education and training varies around the world. It typically involves entry level education at a university [medical school](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_school "Medical school"), followed by a period of supervised practice or [internship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_intern "Medical intern"), or [residency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residency_(medicine) "Residency (medicine)"). This can be followed by postgraduate vocational training. A variety of teaching methods have been employed in medical education, still itself a focus of active research. In Canada and the United States of America, a Doctor of Medicine degree, often abbreviated M.D., or a [Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteopathic_medicine_in_the_United_States "Osteopathic medicine in the United States") degree, often abbreviated as D.O. and unique to the United States, must be completed in and delivered from a recognized university.

Since knowledge, techniques, and medical technology continue to evolve at a rapid rate, many regulatory authorities require [continuing medical education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuing_medical_education "Continuing medical education"). Medical practitioners upgrade their knowledge in various ways, including [medical journals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_journal "Medical journal"), seminars, conferences, and online programs. A database of objectives covering medical knowledge, as suggested by national societies across the United States, can be searched at [http://data.medobjectives.marian.edu/](http://data.medobjectives.marian.edu/) [Archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20181004185930/http://data.medobjectives.marian.edu/) 4 October 2018 at the [Wayback Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayback_Machine "Wayback Machine").<sup id="cite_ref-medObjectives_32-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine#cite_note-medObjectives-32">[32]</a></sup>

In most countries, it is a legal requirement for a medical doctor to be licensed or registered. In general, this entails a medical degree from a university and accreditation by a medical board or an equivalent national organization, which may ask the applicant to pass exams. This restricts the considerable legal authority of the medical profession to physicians that are trained and qualified by national standards. It is also intended as an assurance to patients and as a safeguard against [charlatans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlatan "Charlatan") that practice inadequate medicine for personal gain. While the laws generally require medical doctors to be trained in "evidence based", Western, or [Hippocratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocratic "Hippocratic") Medicine, they are not intended to discourage different paradigms of health.

In the European Union, the profession of doctor of medicine is regulated. A profession is said to be regulated when access and exercise is subject to the possession of a specific professional qualification. The regulated professions database contains a list of regulated professions for doctor of medicine in the EU member states, EEA countries and Switzerland. This list is covered by the Directive 2005/36/EC.

Doctors who are negligent or intentionally harmful in their care of patients can face charges of [medical malpractice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_malpractice "Medical malpractice") and be subject to civil, criminal, or professional sanctions.

## Medical ethics\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Medicine&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Medical ethics")\]

Main article: [Medical ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ethics "Medical ethics")

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/HippocraticOath.jpg/170px-HippocraticOath.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:HippocraticOath.jpg)

A 12th-century [Byzantine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_empire "Byzantine empire") manuscript of the [Hippocratic Oath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocratic_Oath "Hippocratic Oath")

Medical ethics is a system of moral principles that apply values and judgments to the practice of medicine. As a scholarly discipline, medical ethics encompasses its practical application in clinical settings as well as work on its history, philosophy, theology, and sociology. Six of the values that commonly apply to medical ethics discussions are:

- [autonomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomy#Medicine "Autonomy") – the patient has the right to refuse or choose their treatment. ([Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_language "Latin language"): _Voluntas aegroti suprema lex_.)
- [beneficence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beneficence_(ethics) "Beneficence (ethics)") – a practitioner should act in the best interest of the patient. (Latin: _Salus aegroti suprema lex_.)
- [justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_(ethics) "Justice (ethics)") – concerns the distribution of scarce health resources, and the decision of who gets what treatment (fairness and equality).
- [non-maleficence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primum_non_nocere "Primum non nocere") – "first, do no harm" (Latin: _primum non-nocere_).
- [respect for persons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respect_for_persons "Respect for persons") – the patient (and the person treating the patient) have the right to be treated with dignity.
- [truthfulness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth "Truth") and [honesty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honesty "Honesty") – the concept of [informed consent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informed_consent "Informed consent") has increased in importance since the historical events of the [Doctors' Trial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctors%27_Trial "Doctors' Trial") of the Nuremberg trials, [Tuskegee syphilis experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_syphilis_experiment "Tuskegee syphilis experiment"), and others.

Values such as these do not give answers as to how to handle a particular situation, but provide a useful framework for understanding conflicts. When moral values are in conflict, the result may be an ethical [dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilemma "Dilemma") or crisis. Sometimes, no good solution to a dilemma in medical ethics exists, and occasionally, the values of the medical community (i.e., the hospital and its staff) conflict with the values of the individual patient, family, or larger non-medical community. Conflicts can also arise between health care providers, or among family members. For example, some argue that the principles of autonomy and beneficence clash when patients refuse [blood transfusions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_transfusions "Blood transfusions"), considering them life-saving; and truth-telling was not emphasized to a large extent before the HIV era.

### Ancient world\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Medicine&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Ancient world")\]

[Prehistoric medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prehistoric_medicine "Prehistoric medicine") incorporated plants ([herbalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbalism "Herbalism")), animal parts, and minerals. In many cases these materials were used ritually as magical substances by priests, [shamans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamans "Shamans"), or [medicine men](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine_man "Medicine man"). Well-known spiritual systems include [animism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animism "Animism") (the notion of inanimate objects having spirits), [spiritualism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiritualism_(beliefs) "Spiritualism (beliefs)") (an appeal to gods or communion with ancestor spirits); [shamanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamanism "Shamanism") (the vesting of an individual with mystic powers); and [divination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divination "Divination") (magically obtaining the truth). The field of [medical anthropology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_anthropology "Medical anthropology") examines the ways in which culture and society are organized around or impacted by issues of health, health care and related issues.

The earliest known medical texts in the world were found in the ancient [Syrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria "Syria") city of [Ebla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebla "Ebla") and date back to 2500 BCE.<sup id="cite_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine#cite_note-33">[33]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine#cite_note-34">[34]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine#cite_note-35">[35]</a></sup> Other early records on medicine have been discovered from [ancient Egyptian medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egyptian_medicine "Ancient Egyptian medicine"), [Babylonian Medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_Medicine "Babylonian Medicine"), [Ayurvedic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayurveda "Ayurveda") medicine (in the [Indian subcontinent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_subcontinent "Indian subcontinent")), [classical Chinese medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Chinese_medicine "Classical Chinese medicine") (predecessor to the modern [traditional Chinese medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine "Traditional Chinese medicine")), and [ancient Greek medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_medicine "Ancient Greek medicine") and [Roman medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine_in_ancient_Rome "Medicine in ancient Rome").

In Egypt, [Imhotep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imhotep "Imhotep") (3rd millennium BCE) is the first physician in history known by name.

In Greece, the ancient Greek physician [Hippocrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocrates "Hippocrates"), the "father of modern medicine",<sup id="cite_ref-pmid18392218_43-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine#cite_note-pmid18392218-43">[43]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-blackwellpublishing.com_44-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine#cite_note-blackwellpublishing.com-44">[44]</a></sup> laid the foundation for a rational approach to medicine. Hippocrates introduced the [Hippocratic Oath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocratic_Oath "Hippocratic Oath") for physicians, which is still relevant and in use today, and was the first to categorize illnesses as [acute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medical) "Acute (medical)"), [chronic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine) "Chronic (medicine)"), [endemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemic_(epidemiology) "Endemic (epidemiology)") and epidemic, and use terms such as, "exacerbation, [relapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse "Relapse"), resolution, crisis, [paroxysm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paroxysm "Paroxysm"), peak, and [convalescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convalescence "Convalescence")".<sup id="cite_ref-garrison97_45-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine#cite_note-garrison97-45">[45]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-mart90_46-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine#cite_note-mart90-46">[46]</a></sup> The Greek physician [Galen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galen "Galen") was also one of the greatest surgeons of the ancient world and performed many audacious operations, including brain and eye surgeries. After the fall of the [Western Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Roman_Empire "Western Roman Empire") and the onset of the [Early Middle Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Middle_Ages "Early Middle Ages"), the Greek tradition of medicine went into decline in Western Europe, although it continued uninterrupted in the [Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Roman_Empire "Eastern Roman Empire").

Most of our knowledge of ancient [Hebrew medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_medicine "Hebrew medicine") during the [1st millennium BC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1st_millennium_BC "1st millennium BC") comes from the [Torah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torah "Torah"), i.e. the Five Books of [Moses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses "Moses"), which contain various health related laws and rituals. The Hebrew contribution to the development of modern medicine started in the [Byzantine Era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Era "Byzantine Era"), with the physician [Asaph the Jew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asaph_the_Jew "Asaph the Jew").<sup id="cite_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine#cite_note-47">[47]</a></sup>

A manuscript of _[Al-Risalah al-Dhahabiah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Risalah_al-Dhahabiah "Al-Risalah al-Dhahabiah")_ by [Ali al-Ridha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_al-Ridha "Ali al-Ridha"), the eighth Imam of [Shia Muslims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelver "Twelver"). The text says: "Golden dissertation in medicine which is sent by Imam Ali ibn Musa al-Ridha, peace be upon him, to [al-Ma'mun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Ma%27mun "Al-Ma'mun")."

The concept of hospital as institution to offer medical care and possibility of a cure for the patients due to the ideals of Christian charity, rather than just merely a place to die, appeared in the [Byzantine Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire "Byzantine Empire").<sup id="cite_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine#cite_note-48">[48]</a></sup>

Although the concept of [uroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uroscopy "Uroscopy") was known to Galen, he did not see the importance of using it to localize the disease. It was under the Byzantines with physicians such of [Theophilus Protospatharius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theophilus_Protospatharius "Theophilus Protospatharius") that they realized the potential in uroscopy to determine disease in a time when no microscope or stethoscope existed. That practice eventually spread to the rest of Europe.<sup id="cite_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine#cite_note-49">[49]</a></sup>

After 750 CE, the Muslim world had the works of Hippocrates, Galen and Sushruta translated into [Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic "Arabic"), and [Islamic physicians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_medicine "Islamic medicine") engaged in some significant medical research. Notable Islamic medical pioneers include the Persian [polymath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath "Polymath"), [Avicenna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avicenna "Avicenna"), who, along with Imhotep and Hippocrates, has also been called the "father of medicine".<sup id="cite_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine#cite_note-50">[50]</a></sup> He wrote _[The Canon of Medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Canon_of_Medicine "The Canon of Medicine")_ which became a standard medical text at many medieval European [universities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University "University"),<sup id="cite_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine#cite_note-51">[51]</a></sup> considered one of the most famous books in the history of medicine.<sup id="cite_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine#cite_note-52">[52]</a></sup> Others include [Abulcasis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_al-Qasim_al-Zahrawi "Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi"),<sup id="cite_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine#cite_note-53">[53]</a></sup> [Avenzoar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Zuhr "Ibn Zuhr"),<sup id="cite_ref-Rabie2006_54-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine#cite_note-Rabie2006-54">[54]</a></sup> [Ibn al-Nafis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_al-Nafis "Ibn al-Nafis"),<sup id="cite_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine#cite_note-55">[55]</a></sup> and [Averroes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Averroes "Averroes").<sup id="cite_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine#cite_note-56">[56]</a></sup> [Persian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persians "Persians") physician [Rhazes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_ibn_Zakar%C4%ABya_R%C4%81zi "Muhammad ibn Zakarīya Rāzi")<sup id="cite_ref-Tschanz_57-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine#cite_note-Tschanz-57">[57]</a></sup> was one of the first to question the Greek theory of [humorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humorism "Humorism"), which nevertheless remained influential in both medieval Western and medieval Islamic medicine.<sup id="cite_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine#cite_note-58">[58]</a></sup> Some volumes of Rhazes's work _Al-Mansuri_, namely "On Surgery" and "A General Book on Therapy", became part of the medical curriculum in European universities.<sup id="cite_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine#cite_note-59">[59]</a></sup> Additionally, he has been described as a doctor's doctor,<sup id="cite_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine#cite_note-60">[60]</a></sup> the father of pediatrics,<sup id="cite_ref-Tschanz_57-1" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine#cite_note-Tschanz-57">[57]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Elgood_61-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine#cite_note-Elgood-61">[61]</a></sup> and a pioneer of ophthalmology.

In Europe, [Charlemagne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlemagne "Charlemagne") decreed that a hospital should be attached to each cathedral and monastery and the historian [Geoffrey Blainey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Blainey "Geoffrey Blainey") likened the [activities of the Catholic Church in health care](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church_and_health_care "Catholic Church and health care") during the Middle Ages to an early version of a welfare state: "It conducted hospitals for the old and orphanages for the young; hospices for the sick of all ages; places for the lepers; and hostels or inns where pilgrims could buy a cheap bed and meal". It supplied food to the population during famine and distributed food to the poor. This welfare system the church funded through collecting taxes on a large scale and possessing large farmlands and estates. The [Benedictine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benedictine "Benedictine") order was noted for setting up hospitals and infirmaries in their monasteries, growing medical herbs and becoming the chief medical care givers of their districts, as at the great [Abbey of Cluny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbey_of_Cluny "Abbey of Cluny"). The Church also established a network of [cathedral schools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathedral_schools "Cathedral schools") and universities where medicine was studied. The [Schola Medica Salernitana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schola_Medica_Salernitana "Schola Medica Salernitana") in Salerno, looking to the learning of [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeks "Greeks") and [Arab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab "Arab") physicians, grew to be the finest medical school in Medieval Europe.<sup id="cite_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine#cite_note-64">[64]</a></sup>

Siena's [Santa Maria della Scala Hospital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Maria_della_Scala_(Siena) "Santa Maria della Scala (Siena)"), one of Europe's oldest hospitals. During the Middle Ages, the Catholic Church established universities to revive the study of sciences, drawing on the learning of Greek and Arab physicians in the study of medicine.

However, the fourteenth and fifteenth century [Black Death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Death "Black Death") devastated both the Middle East and Europe, and it has even been argued that Western Europe was generally more effective in recovering from the pandemic than the Middle East.<sup id="cite_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine#cite_note-65">[65]</a></sup> In the early modern period, important early figures in medicine and anatomy emerged in Europe, including [Gabriele Falloppio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriele_Falloppio "Gabriele Falloppio") and [William Harvey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Harvey "William Harvey").

The major shift in medical thinking was the gradual rejection, especially during the [Black Death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Death "Black Death") in the 14th and 15th centuries, of what may be called the "traditional authority" approach to science and medicine. This was the notion that because some prominent person in the past said something must be so, then that was the way it was, and anything one observed to the contrary was an anomaly (which was paralleled by a similar shift in European society in general – see [Copernicus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Copernicus "Nicolaus Copernicus")'s rejection of [Ptolemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy "Ptolemy")'s theories on astronomy). Physicians like [Vesalius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesalius "Vesalius") improved upon or disproved some of the theories from the past. The main tomes used both by medicine students and expert physicians were [Materia Medica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materia_Medica "Materia Medica") and [Pharmacopoeia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacopoeia "Pharmacopoeia").

[Andreas Vesalius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Vesalius "Andreas Vesalius") was the author of _[De humani corporis fabrica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_humani_corporis_fabrica "De humani corporis fabrica")_, an important book on [human anatomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_anatomy "Human anatomy").<sup id="cite_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine#cite_note-66">[66]</a></sup> Bacteria and microorganisms were first observed with a microscope by [Antonie van Leeuwenhoek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonie_van_Leeuwenhoek "Antonie van Leeuwenhoek") in 1676, initiating the scientific field [microbiology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiology "Microbiology").<sup id="cite_ref-Brock_67-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine#cite_note-Brock-67">[67]</a></sup> Independently from Ibn al-Nafis, [Michael Servetus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Servetus "Michael Servetus") rediscovered the [pulmonary circulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_circulation "Pulmonary circulation"), but this discovery did not reach the public because it was written down for the first time in the "Manuscript of Paris"<sup id="cite_ref-68" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine#cite_note-68">[68]</a></sup> in 1546, and later published in the theological work for which he paid with his life in 1553. Later this was described by [Renaldus Columbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaldus_Columbus "Renaldus Columbus") and [Andrea Cesalpino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Cesalpino "Andrea Cesalpino"). [Herman Boerhaave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Boerhaave "Herman Boerhaave") is sometimes referred to as a "father of physiology" due to his exemplary teaching in Leiden and textbook 'Institutiones medicae' (1708). [Pierre Fauchard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Fauchard "Pierre Fauchard") has been called "the father of modern [dentistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry "Dentistry")".<sup id="cite_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine#cite_note-69">[69]</a></sup>

Veterinary medicine was, for the first time, truly separated from human medicine in 1761, when the French veterinarian [Claude Bourgelat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Bourgelat "Claude Bourgelat") founded the world's first veterinary school in Lyon, France. Before this, medical doctors treated both humans and other animals.

Modern scientific [biomedical research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomedical_research "Biomedical research") (where results are testable and [reproducible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducible "Reproducible")) began to replace early Western traditions based on herbalism, the Greek "four humours" and other such pre-modern notions. The modern era really began with [Edward Jenner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Jenner "Edward Jenner")'s discovery of the [smallpox vaccine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox_vaccine "Smallpox vaccine") at the end of the 18th century (inspired by the method of [variolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variolation "Variolation") originated in ancient China),<sup id="cite_ref-Williams2010_70-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine#cite_note-Williams2010-70">[70]</a></sup> [Robert Koch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Koch "Robert Koch")'s discoveries around 1880 of the transmission of disease by bacteria, and then the discovery of [antibiotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic "Antibiotic") around 1900.

The post-18th century [modernity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modernity "Modernity") period brought more groundbreaking researchers from Europe. From [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany "Germany") and Austria, doctors [Rudolf Virchow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Virchow "Rudolf Virchow"), [Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Conrad_R%C3%B6ntgen "Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen"), [Karl Landsteiner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Landsteiner "Karl Landsteiner") and [Otto Loewi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Loewi "Otto Loewi") made notable contributions. In the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom "United Kingdom"), [Alexander Fleming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Fleming "Alexander Fleming"), [Joseph Lister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Lister,_1st_Baron_Lister "Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister"), [Francis Crick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Crick "Francis Crick") and [Florence Nightingale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Nightingale "Florence Nightingale") are considered important. [Spanish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain "Spain") doctor [Santiago Ramón y Cajal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_Ram%C3%B3n_y_Cajal "Santiago Ramón y Cajal") is considered the father of modern [neuroscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience "Neuroscience").

From New Zealand and Australia came [Maurice Wilkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Wilkins "Maurice Wilkins"), [Howard Florey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Florey "Howard Florey"), and [Frank Macfarlane Burnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Macfarlane_Burnet "Frank Macfarlane Burnet").

As science and technology developed, medicine became more reliant upon [medications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication "Medication"). Throughout history and in Europe right until the late 18th century, not only plant products were used as medicine, but also animal (including human) body parts and fluids.<sup id="cite_ref-71" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine#cite_note-71">[71]</a></sup> [Pharmacology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology "Pharmacology") developed in part from herbalism and some drugs are still derived from plants ([atropine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atropine "Atropine"), [ephedrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephedrine "Ephedrine"), [warfarin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warfarin "Warfarin"), [aspirin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin "Aspirin"), [digoxin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digoxin "Digoxin"), [_vinca_ alkaloids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinca_alkaloid "Vinca alkaloid"),<sup id="cite_ref-72" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine#cite_note-72">[72]</a></sup> [taxol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxo "Taxo"), [hyoscine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyoscine_hydrobromide "Hyoscine hydrobromide"), etc.).<sup id="cite_ref-73" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine#cite_note-73">[73]</a></sup> [Vaccines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine "Vaccine") were discovered by Edward Jenner and [Louis Pasteur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Pasteur "Louis Pasteur").

The first antibiotic was [arsphenamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsphenamine "Arsphenamine") (Salvarsan) discovered by [Paul Ehrlich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Ehrlich "Paul Ehrlich") in 1908 after he observed that bacteria took up toxic dyes that human cells did not. The first major class of antibiotics was the [sulfa drugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfonamide_(medicine) "Sulfonamide (medicine)"), derived by German chemists originally from [azo dyes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azo_dye "Azo dye").

Pharmacology has become increasingly sophisticated; modern [biotechnology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biotechnology "Biotechnology") allows drugs targeted towards specific physiological processes to be developed, sometimes designed for compatibility with the body to reduce [side-effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect "Side effect"). [Genomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomics "Genomics") and knowledge of [human genetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_genetics "Human genetics") and [human evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_evolution "Human evolution") is having increasingly significant influence on medicine, as the causative [genes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene "Gene") of most monogenic [genetic disorders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder "Genetic disorder") have now been identified, and the development of techniques in [molecular biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_biology "Molecular biology"), [evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution "Evolution"), and [genetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics "Genetics") are influencing medical technology, practice and decision-making.

Evidence-based medicine is a contemporary movement to establish the most effective [algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms "Algorithms") of practice (ways of doing things) through the use of [systematic reviews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review "Systematic review") and [meta-analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis "Meta-analysis"). The movement is facilitated by modern global [information science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_science "Information science"), which allows as much of the available evidence as possible to be collected and analyzed according to standard protocols that are then disseminated to healthcare providers. The [Cochrane Collaboration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Collaboration "Cochrane Collaboration") leads this movement. A 2001 review of 160 Cochrane systematic reviews revealed that, according to two readers, 21.3% of the reviews concluded insufficient evidence, 20% concluded evidence of no effect, and 22.5% concluded positive effect.<sup id="cite_ref-Ezzo2001_74-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine#cite_note-Ezzo2001-74">[74]</a></sup>

## Quality, efficiency, and access\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Medicine&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Quality, efficiency, and access")\]

Evidence-based medicine, prevention of [medical error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_error "Medical error") (and other "[iatrogenesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iatrogenesis "Iatrogenesis")"), and avoidance of [unnecessary health care](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unnecessary_health_care "Unnecessary health care") are a priority in modern medical systems. These topics generate significant political and public policy attention, particularly in the United States where healthcare is regarded as excessively costly but [population health](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_health "Population health") metrics lag similar nations.<sup id="cite_ref-75" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine#cite_note-75">[75]</a></sup>

Globally, many developing countries lack access to care and [access to medicines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_to_medicines "Access to medicines").<sup id="cite_ref-76" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine#cite_note-76">[76]</a></sup> As of 2015<sup class="plainlinks noexcerpt noprint asof-tag update" style="display:none;"><a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Medicine&amp;action=edit">[update]</a></sup>, most wealthy developed countries provide health care to all citizens, with a few exceptions such as the United States where lack of health insurance coverage may limit access.<sup id="cite_ref-77" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine#cite_note-77">[77]</a></sup>
