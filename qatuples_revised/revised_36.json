    "What is an argument indicator of a premise in an argument?",
    "A word or phrase like \"because\" that connects one statement to another, showing a relationship between them.",
    "An alligator is either a reptile or a mammal. 5. Don\u2019t let any reptiles into the house. 6. You may kill any reptile you see in the house. 7. East Africans are not the best distance runners. 8. Obama is not a Democrat. 9. Some humans have wings. 10. Some things with wings cannot fly. 11. Was Obama born in Kenya or Hawaii? 12. Oh no! A grizzly bear! 13. Meet me in St. Louis. 14. We met in St. Louis yesterday. 15. I do not want to meet a grizzly bear in the wild. Chapter 1: Reconstructing and analyzing arguments  4 1.2 Identifying arguments   The best way to identify whether an argument is present is to ask whether there is a statement that someone is trying to establish as true by basing it on some other statement. If so, then there is an argument present. If not, then there isn\u2019t. Another thing that can help in identifying arguments is knowing certain key words or phrases that are premise indicators or conclusion indicators. For example, recall Sally\u2019s abortion argument:  Abortion is morally wrong because it is wrong to take the life of an innocent human being, and a fetus is an innocent human being. The word \u201cbecause\u201d here is a premise indicator.",
