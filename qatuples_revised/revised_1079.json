    "How does our mind's tendency towards representativeness affect the question of probability, according to Kahneman?",
    "Our minds substitute the question of representativeness for the question of probability, leading us to answer incorrectly.",
    "Kahneman thinks that in cases like these, our minds substitute a question of representativeness for the question of probability, thus answering the probability question incorrectly.7 We are distracted from the probability question by seeking representativeness, which our minds more automatically look for and think about than probability. For Kahneman, the psychological explanation is needed to explain why even trained mathematicians and those who deal regularly with probability still commit the conjunction fallacy. The psychological explanation that our brains are wired to look for representativeness, and that we unwittingly substitute the question of representativeness for the question of probability, explains why even experts make these kinds of mistakes. 3.7 The base rate fallacy  Consider the following scenario. You go in for some testing for some health problems you\u2019ve been having and after a number of tests, you test positive for colon cancer. What are the chances that you really do have colon cancer? Let\u2019s                              7 Kahneman gives this explanation numerous places, including, most exhaustively (and for a general audiencein his 2011 book, Thinking Fast and Slow. New York, NY: Farrar, Straus and Giroux. Chapter 3: Evaluating inductive arguments and probabilistic and statistical fallacies  179 suppose that the test is not perfect, but it is 95% accurate. That is, in the case of those who really do have colon cancer, the test will detect the cancer 95% of the time (and thus miss it 5% of the time).",
