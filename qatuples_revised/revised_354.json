    "How does a dot connective differ from an English conjunction in representing temporal information?",
    "A dot connective doesn't care about the temporal aspects of things, while an English conjunction can represent the order of events.",
    "We can see this with English conjunctions like \u201cbut\u201d and \u201chowever\u201d which have a contrastive sense. If I were to say, \u201cBob voted, but Caroline didn\u2019t,\u201d then I am contrasting what but yet also although however moreover nevertheless still Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  56 Bob and Caroline did. Nevertheless, I am still asserting two independent propositions. Another kind of information that English conjunctions represent but the dot connective doesn\u2019t is temporal information. For example, in the conjunction:  Bob brushed his teeth and got into bed  There is clearly a temporal implication that Bob brushed his teeth first and then got into bed. It might sound strange to say:  Bob got into bed and brushed his teeth  since this would seem to imply that Bob brushed his teeth while in bed. But each of these conjunctions would be represented in the same way by our dot connective, since the dot connective does not care about the temporal aspects of things. If we were to represent \u201cBob got into bed\u201d with the capital letter A and \u201cBob brushed his teeth\u201d with the capital letter B, then both of these propositions would be represented exactly the same, namely, like this:  A \u22c5 B  Sometimes a conjunction can be represented in English with just a comma or semicolon, like this:  While Bob vacuumed the floor, Sally washed the dishes.",
