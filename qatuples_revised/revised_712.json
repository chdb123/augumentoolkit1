    "What is a truth table test in propositional logic?",
    "A truth table test evaluates the validity of arguments by examining all possible combinations of truth values for their propositions, determining if the conclusion always follows from the premises.",
    "Formal logic is a kind of logic that looks only at the form, rather than the content (meaningof the statements. We can easily see this by constructing an argument where the atomic propositions use silly, made-up words, such as those from Lewis Carroll\u2019s \u201cJabberwocky\u201d:  1. If toves are slithy, then the borogoves are mimsy 2. Borogoves are not mimsy 3. Therefore, toves are not slithy  If we translate \u201ctoves are slithy\u201d at \u201cT\u201d and \u201cborogoves are mimsy\u201d as \u201cB\u201d then the form of this argument is clearly modus tollens, which is one of the 8 valid forms of inference:  1. T \u2283 B Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  115 2. ~B 3. \u2234 ~T  We can thus see that this argument is valid even though we have no idea what \u201ctoves\u201d or \u201cborogoves\u201d are or what \u201cslithy\u201d and \u201cmimsy\u201d mean. Thus, propositional logic, which includes the truth table test of validity, is a kind of formal logic, whereas the informal test of validity is not. There are other kinds of formal logic besides propositional logic. In the next section I will introduce another kind of formal logic: categorical logic. 2.14 Categorical logic  Consider the following argument:  1.",
