    "How does Fred respond to Tom's argument about health care funding and jobs?",
    "Fred claims that increasing health care funding would risk the state's economic future by not creating jobs and harming Coloradans, which is a straw man fallacy since Tom never said or implied such.",
    "Fred responds to Tom\u2019s argument that we need to increase funding to health care and education as follows: \u201cI am surprised, Tom, that you are willing to put our state\u2019s economic future at risk by sinking money into these programs that do not help to create jobs. You see, folks, Tom\u2019s plan will risk sending our economy into a tailspin, risking harm to thousands of Coloradans. On the other hand, my plan supports a healthy and strong Colorado and would never bet our state\u2019s economic security on idealistic notions that simply don\u2019t work when the rubber meets the road.\u201d  Fred has committed the straw man fallacy. Just because Tom wants to increase funding to health care and education does not mean he does not want to help the economy. Furthermore, increasing funding to health care and education does not entail that fewer jobs will be created. Fred has attacked a position that is not the position that Tom holds, but is in fact a much less plausible, easier to refute position. However, it would be silly for any political candidate to run on a platform that included \u201charming the economy.\u201d Presumably no political candidate would run on such a platform. Nonetheless, this exact kind of straw man is ubiquitous in political discourse in our country. Here is another example. Nancy has just argued that we should provide middle schoolers with sex education classes, including how to use contraceptives so that they can practice safe sex should they end up in the situation where they are having sex.",
