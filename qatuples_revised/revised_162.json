    "What is a valid argument, and how does it differ from an invalid one?",
    "A valid argument has premises that guarantee the truth of its conclusion, while an invalid argument's premises do not ensure the truth of its conclusion.",
    "As this example shows, inductive arguments are defeasible arguments since by adding further information or premises to the argument, we can overturn (defeatthe verdict that the conclusion is well-supported by the premises. Inductive arguments whose premises give us a strong, even if defeasible, reason for accepting the conclusion are called, unsurprisingly, strong inductive arguments. In contrast, an inductive argument that does not provide a strong reason for accepting the conclusion are called weak inductive arguments. Whereas strong inductive arguments are defeasible, valid deductive arguments aren\u2019t. Suppose that instead of saying that most birds fly, premise 2 said that all birds fly. 1. Tweets is a healthy, normally function bird. 2. All healthy, normally functioning birds can fly. 3. Therefore, Tweets can fly. Chapter 1: Reconstructing and analyzing arguments  25  This is a valid argument and since it is a valid argument, there are no further premises that we could add that could overturn the argument\u2019s validity. (True, premise 2 is false, but as we\u2019ve seen that is irrelevant to determining whether an argument is valid.) Even if we were to add the premise that Tweets is 6 ft tall and can run 30 mph, it doesn\u2019t overturn the validity of the argument.",
