    "What is the role of premises in supporting an argument?",
    "Premises support an argument by providing reasons or evidence for the conclusion. They help establish the validity and soundness of the argument.",
    "Although Obama does give an argument for the claim that Assad carried out chemical weapon attacks on civilians, that is simply an assumption of the main argument. Moreover, although the conclusion of the main argument is the one I have indicated above, I think there is another, intermediate conclusion that Chapter 1: Reconstructing and analyzing arguments  44 Obama argues for more directly and that is that if we don\u2019t respond to Assad\u2019s use of chemical weapons, then our own national security will be put at risk. We can clearly see this conclusion stated in paragraph 10. Moreover, the very next phrase in paragraph 11 is a premise indicator, \u201clet me explain why.\u201d Obama goes on to offer reasons for why failing to respond to Assad\u2019s use of chemical weapons would be a danger to our national security. Thus, the conclusion Obama argues more directly for is:  Intermediate conclusion: A failure to respond to Assad\u2019s use of chemical weapons is a threat to our national security. So, if that is the conclusion that Obama argues for most directly, what are the premises that support it? Obama gives several in paragraphs 11-14:  A. If we don\u2019t respond to Assad\u2019s use of chemical weapons, then Assad\u2019s regime will continue using them with impunity. (paragraph 11B. If Assad\u2019s regime uses chemical weapons with impunity, this will effectively erode the ban on them.",
