    "What does 'conservativeness' mean in the context of explanations?",
    "In this context, conservativeness refers to an explanation that doesn't require new or unproven assumptions and is consistent with established beliefs.",
    "Suppose that there are some photographs that vaguely seem to indicate a furry, bipedal humanoid creature that does not look human. My friend Chris offers the following explanation: the creature in those photos is Bigfoot, or Sasquatch. In contrast, I maintain that the creature in the photos is a person in a Bigfoot suit. Given just this evidence (the blurry photos), Chris\u2019s explanation lacks the virtue of conservativeness since his explanation requires the existence of Bigfoot, which is contrary to well-established beliefs that Bigfoot is merely folklore, not a real creature. In contrast, my explanation possesses the virtue of conservativeness since there is nothing about someone dressing up in a costume and being caught on camera (or even someone doing so to play a practical joke or to perpetuate a false belief in a certain populationthat conflicts with well- established beliefs. My explanation doesn\u2019t require the existence of Bigfoot, but just the existence of human beings dressed up to look like Bigfoot. Chapter 3: Evaluating inductive arguments and probabilistic and statistical fallacies  153 It should be stated that some of the examples I have given could illustrate more than one explanatory virtue. For example, the example of the invisible sock gnome hypothesis could illustrate either lack of falsifiability or lack of simplicity. In identifying which explanatory virtues a particular explanation may lack, what is important is that you give the correct reasoning for why the explanation lacks that particular virtue.",
