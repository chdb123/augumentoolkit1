    "What were the two factors mentioned for determining accurate data concerning osteoporosis?",
    "The two factors are being a woman or a man and being over or under 50.",
    "So if you want accurate data concerning probability, you have to take into account all the relevant factors. In the case of osteoporosis, that means knowing whether you are a woman or a man and are over or under 50. The same kind of point applies to my example of getting into Harvard. Here\u2019s an anecdote that will illustrate the point. Some years ago, I agreed to be a part of an interviewing process for candidates for the \u201cpresidential scholarship\u201d at the college at which I was teaching at the time. The interviewees were high school students and we could have calculated the probability that any one of them would win the scholarship simply by noting the number of scholarships available and the number of applicants for them. But after having interviewed the candidates I was given to interview, it was very clear to me that one of them easily outshined all the rest. Thus, given the new information I had, it would have been silly for me to assign the same, generic probability to this student winning the award. This student was extremely well-spoken, well-put-together, and answered even my hardest questions (with which other candidates struggledwith an ease and confidence that stunned me. On top of all of that, she was a Hispanic woman, which I knew would only help her in the process (since colleges value diversity in their student population). I recommended her highly for the scholarship, but I also knew that she would end up at a much better institution (and probably with one of their most competitive scholarships).",
