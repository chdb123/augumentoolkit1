    "How does the shift from landlines to cell phones impact random sampling?",
    "The shift from landlines to cell phones makes it more difficult to obtain a representative sample, as many people no longer own landlines but only cell phones.",
    "In this way, organizations like Gallup are able to get something close to a random sample and are able to represent the whole U.S. population with a sample size as small as 1000 (with a margin of error of +/- 4). As technology and social factors change, random sampling techniques have to be updated. For example, although Gallup used to call only landlines, eventually this method became biased because many people no longer owned landlines, but only cell phones. If some new kind of technology replaces cell phones and landlines, then Gallup will have to adjust the way it obtains a sample in order to reflect the changing social reality. Exercise 22: What kinds of problems, if any, do the following statistical generalizations have? If there is a problem with the generalization, specify which of the two conditions (adequate sample size, non-biased sampleare not met. Some generalizations may have multiple problems. If so, specify all of the problems you see with the generalization. 1. Bob, from Silverton, CO drives a 4x4 pickup truck, so most people from Silverton, CO drive 4x4 pickup trucks. 2. Tom counts and categorizes birds that land in the tree in his backyard every morning from 5:00-5:20 am. He counts mostly Mourning Doves and generalizes, \u201cmost birds that land in my tree in the morning are Mourning Doves.\u201d 3.",
