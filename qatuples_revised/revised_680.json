    "How can you use addition on line 8 to derive '~A v B' and then plug it into line 1 for modus ponens?",
    "By using addition on line 8, we get ~A v (B v G), which means \"Not A or not-G\". Then we plug this into line 1 as the antecedent of a conditional statement with \"L\" as the consequent. Modus ponens allows us to derive L from this, giving us L v G.",
    "Look at lines 2 and 3. You should see a modus tollens there. That will be our next step:  8. ~A  Modus tollens 2, 3  The next step of this proof can be a bit tricky. There are a couple different ways we could go. One would be to utilize the rule \u201caddition.\u201d Can you see how we might helpfully utilize this rule using either line 6 or 8? If not, I\u2019ll give you a hint: what if we were to use addition on line 8 to derive \u201c~A v B\u201d? Can you see how we could then plug that into line 1? In fact, \u201c~A v B\u201d is the antecedent of the conditional in line 1, so we could then use modus ponens to derive the consequent. Thus, let\u2019s try starting with the addition on line 8:  9. ~A v B Addition 8  Next, we\u2019ll utilize line 9 and line 1 with modus ponens to derive the next line:  10. L  Modus ponens 1, 9  Notice at this point that what we have derived on line 10 is \u201cL\u201d and what we earlier said we needed as one of the conjuncts was \u201cL v G\u201d. You should recognize that we have a rule that will allow us to infer directly from \u201cL\u201d to \u201cL v G\u201d. That rule is addition (again).",
