    "The primary purpose of a formal method is to create a precise and objective standard for determining argument validity, overcoming issues with the informal test's imprecision and subjectivity.",
    "The informal test relies on our ability to imagine certain kinds of scenarios as well as our understanding of the statements involved in the argument. Because not everyone has the same powers of imagination or the same understanding, this informal test of validity is neither precise nor objective. For example, while one person may be able to imagine a scenario in which the premises of an argument are true while the conclusion is false, another person may be unable to imagine such a scenario. As a result, the argument will be classified as invalid by the first individual, but valid by the second individual. That is a problem because we would like our standard of evaluation of arguments (i.e., validityto be as precise and objective as possible, and it seems that our informal test of validity is neither. It isn\u2019t precise because the concept of being able to imagine x is not precise\u2014what counts as imagining x is not something that can be clearly specified. What are the precise success conditions for having imagined a scenario where the premises are true and the conclusion is false? But the informal test of validity also isn\u2019t objective since it is possible that two different people who applied the imagination test correctly could come to two different conclusions about whether the argument is valid. As I noted before, this is partly because people\u2019s understanding of the statements differ and partly because people have different powers of imagination. The goal of a formal method of evaluation is to eliminate any imprecision or lack of objectivity in evaluating arguments.",
