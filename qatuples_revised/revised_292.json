    "How does Premise 4 relate to the conclusion about U.S. troops facing chemical weapons on the battlefield?",
    "Premise 4 states that if other tyrants attain and use chemical weapons, U.S. troops will be more likely to face them on the battlefield. The conclusion follows from this premise by asserting that Iran having a nuclear program increases the likelihood of others using chemical weapons.",
    "For example, how is Iran having a Chapter 1: Reconstructing and analyzing arguments  45 nuclear program a threat to our national security? It seems there must be an implicit premise\u2014not yet stated\u2014that is to the effect that all of these things are threats to national security. Here is one way of construing that missing premise:  Missing premise 1: An increased likelihood of U.S. troops or allies facing chemical weapons on the battlefield or Iran becoming emboldened to develop a nuclear program are all threats to U.S. national security interests. We can also make explicit within the standard form argument other intermediate conclusions that follow from the stated premises. Although we don\u2019t have to do this, it can be a helpful thing to do when an argument contains multiple premises. For example, we could explicitly state the conclusion that follows from the four conditional statements that are the first four premises:  1. If we don\u2019t respond to Assad\u2019s use of chemical weapons, then Assad\u2019s regime will continue using them with impunity. 2. If Assad\u2019s regime uses chemical weapons with impunity, this will effectively erode the ban on them. 3. If the ban on chemical weapons erodes, then other tyrants will be more likely to attain and use them. 4. If other tyrants attain and use chemical weapons, U.S. troops will be more likely to face chemical weapons on the battlefield. 5.",
