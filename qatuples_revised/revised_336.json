    "What is a conjunction in the context of logic?",
    "A conjunction is a complex proposition using 'and' to connect two or more atomic propositions, like \"the floor has been mopped and the dishes have been washed.\" Its truth value depends on both atomic propositions being true. If one is false, the whole conjunction is false.",
    "Thus, for our purposes, we can treat a proposition as the same thing as a statement. Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  53 We can also connect propositions together using certain English words, such as \u201cand\u201d like this:  The floor has been mopped and the dishes have been washed. This proposition is called a complex proposition because it contains the connective \u201cand\u201d which connects two separate propositions. In contrast, \u201cthe floor has been mopped\u201d and \u201cthe dishes have been washed\u201d are what are called atomic propositions. Atomic propositions are those that do not contain any truth-functional connectives. The word \u201cand\u201d in this complex proposition is a truth-functional connective. A truth-functional connective is a way of connecting propositions such that the truth value of the resulting complex proposition can be determined by the truth value of the propositions that compose it. Suppose that the floor has not been mopped but the dishes have been washed. In that case, if I assert the conjunction, \u201cthe floor has been mopped and the dishes have been washed,\u201d then I have asserted something that is false. The reason is that a conjunction, like the one above, is only true when each conjunct (i.e., each statement that is conjoined by the \u201cand\u201dis true. If either one of the conjuncts is false, then the whole conjunction is false. This should be pretty obvious.",
