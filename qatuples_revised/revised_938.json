    "How does the number of Subarus owned affect the strength of an argument about their reliability?",
    "The more Subarus one owns, the stronger the inference can be made about their reliability, as long as other relevant factors are considered (such as engine and transmission). A larger reference class allows for a less hasty generalization. However, even with many Subarus, knowing specific details about the new car's origin is crucial to make a strong argument.",
    "If I\u2019ve only owned one, then the inference seems fairly weak (perhaps I was just lucky in that one Subaru I\u2019ve owned). If I\u2019ve owned ten Subarus then the inference seems much stronger. Thus, the reference class that I\u2019m drawing on (in this case, the number of Subarus I\u2019ve previously ownedmust be large enough to generalize from (otherwise we would be committing the fallacy of \u201chasty generalization\u201d). However, even if our reference class was large enough, what would make the inference even stronger is knowing not simply that the new car is a Subaru, but also specific things about its origin. For example, if I know that this particular model has the same engine and same transmission as the previous model I owned and that nothing significant has changed in how Subarus are made in the intervening time, then my argument is strengthened. In contrast, if this new Subaru was made after Subaru was bought by some other car company, and if the engine and transmission were actually made by this new car company, then my argument is weakened. It should be obvious why: the fact that the car is still called \u201cSubaru\u201d is not relevant establishing that it will have the same characteristics as the other cars that I\u2019ve owned that were called \u201cSubarus.\u201d  Clearly, what the car is called has no inherent relevance to whether the car is reliable. Rather, what is relevant to whether the car is reliable is the quality of the parts and assembly of the car.",
