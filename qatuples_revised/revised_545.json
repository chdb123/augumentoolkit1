    "What is the difference between a sufficient condition and a necessary condition?",
    "A sufficient condition must be present for an outcome to happen, while a necessary condition ensures it does not happen without the presence of the other condition.",
    "Here are some equivalent ways of expressing the conditional, \u201cif it is raining then the ground is wet\u201d:  It is raining only if the ground is wet  The ground is wet if is raining  Only if the ground is wet is it raining  That it is raining implies that the ground is wet  That it is raining entails that the ground is wet  As long as it is raining, the ground will be wet  So long as it is raining, the ground will be wet  The ground is wet, provided that it is raining  Whenever it is raining, the ground is wet  If it is raining, the ground is wet Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  89  All of these conditional statements are symbolized the same way, namely R \u2283 G.  The antecedent of a conditional statement always lays down what logicians call a sufficient condition. A sufficient condition is a condition that suffices for some other condition to obtain. To say that x is a sufficient condition for y is to say that any time x is present, y will thereby be present. For example, a sufficient condition for dying is being decapitated; a sufficient condition for being a U.S. citizen is being born in the U.S. The consequent of a conditional statement always lays down a necessary condition. A necessary condition is a condition that must be in present in order for some other condition to obtain.",
