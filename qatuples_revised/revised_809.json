    "How does the Venn test of validity relate to understanding categories in a syllogism?",
    "The Venn test of validity is a formal evaluation method that allows determining whether an argument is valid without understanding what the categories represent in the world.",
    "The strategy is that we should always map universal statements before mapping particular statements. Here is a categorical syllogism that illustrates this point. This time I am going to switch to just using the capital letters S, P, and M to represent the categories. Recall that we can do this because the Venn test of validity is a formal evaluation method where we don\u2019t have to actually understand what the categories represent in the world in order to determine whether the argument is valid. 1. Some S are M 2. All M are P 3.",
