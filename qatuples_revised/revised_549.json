    "How can you translate Exercise 13's sentence 'Tom will pass the class provided that he does all the homework' into a symbolic logic sentence in 'Introduction to Logic and Critical Thinking'?",
    "P \u2192 H \u2192 T (Doing all homework guarantees passing the class for Tom)",
    "To say that x is a necessary condition for y is to say that if x were not present, y would not be present either. For example, a necessary condition for being President of the U.S. is being a U.S. citizen; a necessary condition for having a brother is having a sibling. Notice, however, that being a U.S. citizen is not a sufficient condition for being President, and having a sibling is not a sufficient condition for having a brother. Likewise, being born in the U.S. is not a necessary condition for being a U.S. citizen (people can become \u201cnaturalized citizens\u201d), and being decapitated is not a necessary condition for dying (one can die without being decapitated). Exercise 13: Translate the following English sentences into symbolic logic sentences using the constants indicated. Make sure you write out what the atomic propositions are. In some cases this will be straightforward, but not in every case. Remember: atomic propositions never contain any truth functional connectives\u2014and that includes negation! Note: although many of these sentences can be translated using only the horseshoe, others require truth functional connectives other than the horseshoe. 1. The Tigers will win only if the Indians lose their star pitcher. (T, I2. Tom will pass the class provided that he does all the homework. (P, H) 3. The car will run only if it has gas. (R, G) 4.",
