    "What factors contribute to a strong analogy in an argument?",
    "Factors contributing to a strong analogy include relevant similarities between past events and current situations, and shared characteristics between objects or entities under consideration.",
    "It could have likely been some other breed in the same circumstances. So it isn\u2019t \u201cpoodleness\u201d that accounts for the biting. That said, if we had evidence that poodles are much more likely to bite than other breeds then this argument would be stronger. 3. Strong. Unlike, the last one, this argument delivers a much stronger analogy between past events (poodle-encounters and poodle-bitingsand the current event (poodle-encounter). 4. Strong. The relevant similarities are: 1) Van Cleave\u2019s class doesn\u2019t change much from semester to semester, 2) the person has the same abilities as their friend who got the A. 5. Weak. Although both are crimes, there are many relevant differences between committing rape and robbing a bank. 6. Weak. There is no particular relationship between having seats, wheels, and brakes, on the one hand, and being safe to drive, on the other. So having seats, wheels and brakes is not a relevant similarity between the two cars, if what we are interested in is how safe they are. 7. Strong. The car company (Volvo) is a relevant similarity between the old cars and the new car. We can expect similar quality between cars from the same company. In contrast, knowing that a car as wheels, brakes and seats tells us essentially nothing about its quality, including its safety. 8. Strong. 9. Weak.",
