    "What is the probability of getting osteoporosis for a man over 50, according to the text?",
    "The probability of getting osteoporosis for a man over 50 is 4%, as mentioned in the text. However, this is relative to women over 50 having a higher rate of 16%.",
    "The result is the probability that event a will not occur:   P(not-a= 1 \u2013 P(a)  For example, suppose I am playing monopoly and I wanted to determine the probability that I do not roll a 12 (since if I roll a 12 I will land on Boardwalk, which my opponent owns with hotels). Since we have already determined that the probability of rolling a 12 is .028, we can calculate the probability of not rolling a 12 thus:   1 \u2013 .028 = .972  Thus, I have 97.2% chance of not rolling a 12. So it is highly likely that I won\u2019t (thank goodness). Here\u2019s another example. What are the chances that my daughter doesn\u2019t get into Harvard? Since the acceptance rate at Harvard is about 6% (or .06), I simply subtract that from 1, which yields .94, or 94%. So my daughter has a 94% chance of not getting into Harvard. We should pause here to make some comments about probability. The probability of an event occurring is relative to some reference class. So, for example, the probability of getting osteoporosis is much higher if you are a Chapter 3: Evaluating inductive arguments and probabilistic and statistical fallacies  173 woman over 50 (16%) than if you are a man over 50 (4%).",
