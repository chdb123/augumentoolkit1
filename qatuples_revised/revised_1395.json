    "How does Steve's sample differ from the general population, and why is this a problem for his conclusions?",
    "Steve's sample differs because he surveyed only Ani Difranco concert-goers, who are not representative of all concert-goers. This makes his conclusions unreliable since Ani Difranco is very political and the sample will have a higher proportion of such speech.",
    "This seems a good generalization. Telephone polls are a good way of getting a random sample, and the sample size is large enough if a good random sampling technique is used. Answers to exercises  229 9. Sampling bias because of the biased way the question is asked: \u201ckilling innocent children\u201d uses strong, evaluative language and may influence how people answer, making them more likely to choose option b over option a (who wants to say they support \u201ckilling innocent children\u201d?). 10. Steve\u2019s problem is that he has gotten a biased sample. Ani Difranco concert-goers are not representative of concert-goers tout court. Since Ani Difranco is very political (and from a feminist perspective), we should expect to see a much higher proportion of such speech at an Ani Difranco concert.

Thus, since the principal\u2019s survey was only administered to students in detention, the rate of dissatisfaction will be much higher, which will make the sample unrepresentative and the generalization bad. 12.
