    "How does simplicity and conservativeness interact in scientific explanations?",
    "Simplicity tells us that if observed facts can be explained without new entities, then that explanation is preferable; conservativeness tells us that better explanations are ones that force us to give up fewer well-established beliefs. When comparing two explanations that explain all the observed facts but conflict with well-established beliefs, conservativeness is a virtue for the one that doesn't conflict.",
    "For example, the elementary particle dubbed \u201cthe Higgs boson\u201d was hypothesized by Peter Higgs (and othersin 1964 and was confirmed in 2012. Much earlier, in 1897, J.J. Thompson and his collaborators, drawing on the work of earlier German physicists, discovered the electron\u2014one of the first elementary particles to be discovered. So there is nothing wrong with positing new laws or entities\u2014that is how science progresses. Simplicity doesn\u2019t say that one should never posit new entities; that would be absurd. Rather, it tells us that if the observed facts can be explained without having to posit new entities, then that explanation is preferable to an explanation that does posit new entities (all other things being equal). Of course, sometimes the observations cannot be explained without having to change the way we understand that world. This is when it is legitimate to posit new entities or scientific laws. The last explanatory virtue\u2014conservativeness\u2014tells us that better explanations are ones that force us to give up fewer well-established beliefs. Like simplicity, conservativeness is an explanatory virtue only when we are considering two explanations that each explain all the observed facts, but where one conflicts with well-established beliefs and the other doesn\u2019t. In such a case, the former explanation would lack the explanatory virtue of conservativeness, whereas the latter explanation would possess the virtue of conservativeness. Here is an example to illustrate the virtue of conservativeness.",
