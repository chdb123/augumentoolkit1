    "Truth Table:",
    "However, if I assert it and it is raining but the ground isn\u2019t wet (i.e., the second line of the truth table below), then my statement has been shown to be false. Why? Because I\u2019m asserting that any time it is raining, the ground is wet. But if it is raining but the ground isn\u2019t wet, then this scenario is a counterexample to my claim\u2014it shows that my claim is false. Now consider the scenario in which it is not raining but the ground is wet. Would this scenario show that my conditional statement is false? No, it wouldn\u2019t. The reason is that Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  87 the conditional statement R \u2283 G is only asserting something about what is the case when it is raining. So this conditional statement isn\u2019t asserting anything about those scenarios in which it isn\u2019t raining. I\u2019m only saying that when it is raining, the ground is wet. But that doesn\u2019t mean that the ground couldn\u2019t be wet for other reasons (e.g., a sprinkler watering the grass). So the meaning of the material conditional should count a statement true whenever its antecedent is false. Thus, in a scenario in which it is neither raining nor the ground is wet (i.e., the fourth line of the truth table), the conditional statement should still be true. Would the fact of a sunny day and dry ground show that the conditional R \u2283 G is false? Of course not!",
