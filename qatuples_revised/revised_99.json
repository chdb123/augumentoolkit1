    "How does paraphrasing premises help in reconstructing arguments, according to 'Introduction to Logic and Critical Thinking'?",
    "Paraphrasing premises helps make the argument clearer by using different words that capture the same idea, allowing for better understanding of the essence of the argument.",
    "But since Albert looks like he has just run (since he is panting hard), it follows that Caroline must have ran too. 10. Just because Jeremy\u2019s prints were on the gun that killed Tim and the gun was registered to Jeremy, it doesn\u2019t follow that Jeremy killed Tim since Jeremy\u2019s prints would certainly be on his own gun and someone else could have stolen Jeremy\u2019s gun and used it to kill Tim. 1.5 Using your own paraphrases of premises and conclusions to reconstruct arguments in standard form  Although sometimes we can just lift the premises and conclusion verbatim from the argument, we cannot always do this. Paraphrases of premises or conclusions are sometimes needed in order to make the standard form argument as clear as possible. A paraphrase is the use of different words to capture the same idea in a clearer way. There will always be multiple ways of paraphrasing premises and conclusions and this means that there will never be just one way of putting an argument into standard form. In order to paraphrase well, you will have to rely on your understanding of English to come up with what you think is the best way of capturing the essence of the argument. Again, typically there is no single right way to do this, although there are certainly better and worse ways of doing it.",
