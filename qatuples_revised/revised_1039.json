    "How does the concept of conditional probability relate to the example of rolling a 12 with two six-sided dice?",
    "Conditional probability relates to the example because it is used to calculate the chance of rolling a 12, which requires both dice showing a 6. The formula for this is P(A and B= P(A | B), where A represents rolling a 6 on the first die and B represents rolling a 6 on the second die.",
    "But the chance of both of them dying of brain cancer is going to be an even smaller number:   .00005 \u00d7 .00005 = .0000000025  Chapter 3: Evaluating inductive arguments and probabilistic and statistical fallacies  172 That is almost 1 in a billion chance. So not very likely. Let\u2019s consider a final example with more manageable numbers. Suppose I wanted to know the probability of rolling a 12 when rolling two, six-sided dice. Since the only way to roll a 12 is when I roll a 6 on each die, I can compute the probability of rolling a 6 and then the independent probability of rolling another 6 on the other die. The probability of rolling a six on 1 die is just 1/6 = .166. Thus,   .166 \u00d7 .166 = .028  Thus, you have a 2.8% chance of rolling a 12. We could have also calculated this using fractions instead of decimals:   1/6 \u00d7 1/6 = 1/36  Calculating the probability of negations is simply a matter of subtracting the probability that some event, say event a, will occur from 1.",
