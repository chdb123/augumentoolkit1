    "What is the relationship between the truth of premises and the conclusion in an argument?",
    "The truth of the premises does not determine the validity of an argument; rather, it's the logical relationship between them that matters. A valid argument can have false premises but still be true if the conclusion follows logically from them.",
    "Thus we know that on the assumption of the truth of the premises, the conclusion must be true. And that means the argument is valid. In this example, however, premises 1, 2, and 3 are not only assumed to be true but are actually true. However, as we have already seen, the validity of an argument does not depend on its premises actually being true. Here is another example of a valid argument to illustrate that point. 1. A person can be President of the United States only if they were born in Kenya 2. Obama is President of the United States  3. Therefore, Obama was born in Kenya (from 1-2 Clearly, the first premise of this argument is false. But if we were to imagine a scenario in which it is true and in which premise 2 is also true, then the conclusion (\u201cObama was born in Kenya\u201d) must be true. And this means that the argument is valid. We cannot imagine a scenario in which the premises of the argument are true and yet the conclusion is false. The important point to recognize here\u2014a point I\u2019ve been trying to reiterate throughout this section\u2014is that the validity of the argument does not depend on whether or not the Chapter 1: Reconstructing and analyzing arguments  22 premises (or conclusion) are actually true. Rather, validity depends only on the logical relationship between the premises and the conclusion.",
