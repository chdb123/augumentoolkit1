    "What was the reason given for the eyewitness not being able to escape the lava in Pompeii during the Vesuvius eruption?",
    "The lava was flowing too fast and there was nowhere to go to escape it in time.",
    "Vesuvius. The reason is simple: the lava was flowing too fast and there was nowhere to go to escape it in time. Therefore, this account of the eruption, which claims to have been written by an eyewitness living in Pompeii, was not actually written by an eyewitness. The main conclusion of this argument\u2014the statement that depends on other statements as evidence but doesn\u2019t itself provide any evidence for any other statement\u2014is:  A. This account of the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius was not actually written by an eyewitness. Chapter 1: Reconstructing and analyzing arguments  11  However, the argument\u2019s structure is more complex than simply having a couple of premises that provide evidence directly for the conclusion. Rather, some statement provides evidence directly for the main conclusion, but that statement itself is supported by another statement. To determine the structure of an argument, we must determine which statements support which. We can use our premise and conclusion indicators to help with this. For example, the passage contains the phrase, \u201cthe reason is\u2026\u201d which is a premise indicator, and it also contains the conclusion indicator, \u201ctherefore.\u201d That conclusion indicator helps us to identify the main conclusion, but the more important thing to see is that statement A does not itself provide evidence or support for any of the other statements in the argument, which is the clearest reason why statement A is the main conclusion of the argument. The next question we must answer is: which statement most directly supports A?",
