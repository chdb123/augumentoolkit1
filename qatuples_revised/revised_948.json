    "What is the total amount of money saved in a year, if one gives up two $5 coffees per week?",
    "$2080 a year.",
    "With the money that you could save from forgoing these luxuries, you could, quite literally, save a child\u2019s life. Suppose (to use myself as an exampleI were to buy two $5 coffees a week (a conservative estimate). That is $10 a week, roughly $43 a month and $520 a year. Were I to donate that amount (just $40/month) to an organization such as the Against Malaria Foundation, I could save a child\u2019s                              1 This argument comes (with interpretive liberties on my part) from Peter Singer\u2019s, \u201cThe Singer Solution to World Poverty\u201d published in the NY Times Magazine, September 5, 1999. Chapter 3: Evaluating inductive arguments and probabilistic and statistical fallacies  157 life in just six years.2 Given these facts, and comparing these two scenarios (Bob\u2019s and your own), the argument from analogy proceeds like this:  1. Bob chose to have a luxury item for himself rather than to save the life of a child. 2. \u201cWe\u201d regularly choose having luxury items rather than saving the life of a child. 3. What Bob did was morally wrong. 4. Therefore, what we are doing is morally wrong as well. The two things being compared here are Bob\u2019s situation and our own.",
