    "What is a false statement?",
    "A false statement is one that can be proven untrue or contradictory. An example given in the text is \"The Yangtze is a river in Japan.\"",
    "For example, the sentence,  The Yangtze is a river in Japan  is still a statement; it is just a false statement (the Yangtze River is in China). In contrast, none of the following sentences are statements:  Please help yourself to more casserole  Don\u2019t tell your mother about the surprise  Do you like Vietnamese pho? The reason that none of these sentences are statements is that it doesn\u2019t make sense to ask whether those sentences are true or false (rather, they are requests or commands, and questions, respectively). So, to reiterate: all arguments are composed of premises and conclusions, which are both types of statements. The premises of the argument provide a reason for thinking that the conclusion is true. And arguments typically involve more than one premise. A standard way of capturing the structure of an argument is by numbering the premises and conclusion. For example, recall Sally\u2019s argument against abortion:  Abortion is morally wrong because it is wrong to take the life of an innocent human being, and a fetus is an innocent human being. We could capture the structure of that argument like this:  1. It is morally wrong to take the life of an innocent human being 2. A fetus is an innocent human being 3.",
