    "How does adding a negation change the truth value of a statement, using Cincinnati as an example?",
    "Adding a negation changes the truth value from false to true. For instance, \"Cincinnati is not the capital of Ohio\" becomes true, while the original statement \"Cincinnati is the capital of Ohio\" is false.",
    "Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  59  But another way of adding the negation is with the phrase, \u201cit is not the case that\u201d like this:  It is not the case that dogs are mammals. Either of these English sentences expresses the same proposition, which is simply the negation of the atomic proposition, \u201cdogs are mammals.\u201d Of course, that proposition is false since it is true that dogs are mammals. Just as we can make a true statement false by negating it, we can also make a false statement true by adding a negation. For example, the statement, \u201cCincinnati is the capital of Ohio\u201d is false. But we can make that statement true by adding a negation:  Cincinnati is not the capital of Ohio  There are many different ways of expressing negations in English. Here are a few ways of expressing the previous proposition in different ways in English:  Cincinnati isn\u2019t the capital of Ohio  It\u2019s not true that Cincinnati is the capital of Ohio  It is not the case that Cincinnati is the capital of Ohio  Each of these English sentences express the same true proposition, which is simply the negation of the atomic proposition, \u201cCincinnati is the capital of Ohio.\u201d Since that statement is false, its negation is true. There is one respect in which negation differs from the other three truth- functional connectives that we will introduce in this chapter.",
