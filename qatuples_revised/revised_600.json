    "What does the symbol '\u2283' represent in logical arguments?",
    "The symbol '\u2283' represents \"if... then\" or the conditional operator, indicating that the statement on the left is a hypothesis and the one on the right is the conclusion. It signifies a possible relationship between them.",
    "(A \u22c5 B\u2283 C 2. (A \u22c5 B) 3. \u2234 C  In this argument we can assert C according to the rule, modus ponens. This is so even though the antecedent of the conditional is itself complex (i.e., it is a conjunction). That doesn\u2019t matter. The first premise is still a conditional statement (since the horseshoe is the main operator) and the second premise is the antecedent of that conditional statement. The rule modus ponens says that if we have that much, we are entitled to infer the consequent of the conditional. We can actually use modus ponens in the first argument of this section:  1. (R v S) \u2283 (T \u2283 K) 2. ~K 3. R v S /\u2234 ~T Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  98 4. T \u2283 K Modus ponens, lines 1, 3  What I have done here is I have written the valid form of inference (or rule) that justifies the line I am deriving, as well as the lines to which that rule applies, to the right of the new line of the proof that I am deriving. Here I have derived \u201cT \u2283 K\u201d from lines 1 and 3 of the argument by modus ponens. Notice that line 1 is a conditional statement and line 3 is the antecedent of that conditional statement.",
