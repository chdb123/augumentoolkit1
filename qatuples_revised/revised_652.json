    "Better players will be able to amake fewer mistakes, b) construct the proofs more quickly, and c) construct the proofs more efficiently. In order to construct proofs, it is imperative that you internalize the 8 valid forms of inference introduced in the previous section. You will be citing these forms of inference as rules that will justify each new line of your proof that you add. By \u201cinternalize\u201d I mean that you have memorized them so well that you can see those forms manifest in various sentences almost without even thinking about it. If you internalize the rules in this way, constructing proofs will be a pleasant diversion, rather than a frustrating activity. In addition to internalizing the 8 valid forms of inference, there are a couple of different strategies that can help when you\u2019re stuck and can\u2019t figure out what to do next. The first is the strategy of working backwards. When we work backwards in a proof, we ask ourselves what rule we can use to derive the sentence(s) we need to derive. Here is an example:  1. R \u22c5 S 2. T  /\u2234 (T v L) \u22c5 (R \u22c5 S)  The conclusion, which is to the right of the second premise and follows the \u201c/\u2234\u201d symbol, is a conjunction (since the dot is the main operator). If we are trying to \u201cwork backwards,\u201d the relevant question to ask is: What rule can we use to derive a conjunction? If you know the rules, you should know the answer to that question.",
