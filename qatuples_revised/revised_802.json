    "How can you represent a premise that does not specify whether a category intersects with another?",
    "To accurately represent such a premise, we must adopt a new convention, like using an asterisks to indicate uncertainty or unknown information.",
    "Therefore, some two-legged creatures are bears  There are three categories referred to in this categorical syllogism:   Mammals  Bears  Two-legged creatures  As always, we will put the \u201cS\u201d term of the conclusion on the left of our three category Venn, the \u201cP\u201d term on the right, and the remaining term in the middle, as follows:    Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  135 Now we need to represent the first premise, which means we need to put an asterisk in the intersection of the \u201cmammals\u201d and \u201cbears\u201d categories. However, here we have a choice to make. Since the intersection of the \u201cbears\u201d and \u201cmammals\u201d categories contains a section that is outside the \u201ctwo-legged creatures\u201d category and a section that is inside the \u201ctwo-legged creatures\u201d category, we must choose between representing the particular as part of the \u201ctwo-legged creatures\u201d category or not. But neither of these can be right, since the first premise says nothing at all about whether the thing that is both a bear and a mammal is two-legged! Thus, in order to accurately represent the information contained in this premise, we must adopt a new convention.",
