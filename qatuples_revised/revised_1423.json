    "What is a relevant similarity and what is an irrelevant one in determining how fast someone can run a race?",
    "A relevant similarity is running the same number of miles; an irrelevant one is comparing to an elite runner's mile repeats.",
    "A birthday party and a funeral are not relevantly similar in this case. A funeral is a much more important family event than a birthday party (typically). So we should not expect similarity with respect to a professor\u2019s absence policy when comparing birthday parties to funerals. 10. Weak. Although both may influence happiness, the relevant difference is that whereas heart and brain surgery are typically a matter of life and death (and hence much more likely to be paid for by insurance), cosmetic surgery is not a matter of life and death. 11.

Answers to exercises  233 12. Whether this famous argument for the existence of God is strong or weak is a matter of some debate. One reason for saying it is a weak argument is that there is a disanalogy between artificial objects and natural objects, since complex natural objects may evolve without being designed by an intelligent designer, whereas no artificial objects (yetcan evolve on their own. 13. Weak. Running the same number of miles as an elite runner is not a relevant similarity for determining how fast one will run a race. The relevant dissimilarity here is that although Bekele runs his mile repeats at close to 4:00 flat, I can only run mine at 5:30.",
