    "How does the base rate affect the probability of identifying a terrorist, given the machine's accuracy and number of people?",
    "The base rate is the likelihood that any given individual is a terrorist. In this case, it's low since there's only one terrorist in a building with 3000 people. The machine's accuracy means it will misidentify 10% of non-terrorists as terrorists, leading to 30 false positives. So the probability of any individual being a terrorist is lower than the base rate.",
    "The first 30 people pass without triggering a positive identification from the machine, but on the very next person, the machine triggers a positive identification of terrorist intent. The question is: what are the chances that the person who set off the machine really is a terrorist?8 Consider the following three possibilities: a90%, b) 10%, or c) .3%. If you answered 90%, then you committed the base rate fallacy again. The actually answer is \u201cc\u201d\u2014less than 1%! Here\u2019s why. The base rate is the likelihood that any given individual is a terrorist and this is exceedingly low since there is only one terrorist in the building and there are 3000 people in the building. That means the probability of any one person being a terrorist, before any results of the test, is exceedingly low: 1/3000. Since the test is 90% accurate, that means that out of the 2999 non-terrorists, it will misidentify 10% of them as terrorists = ~300 false positives. Assuming the machine doesn\u2019t misidentify the one actual terrorist, the machine will identify a total of 301 individuals as those \u201cpossessing terrorist intent.\u201d The probability that any one of them actually possesses terrorist intent is 1/301 = .3%. So the probability is drastically lower than 90%. It\u2019s not even close.",
