    "This proof isn\u2019t finished yet, since we have not yet derived the conclusion we are trying to derive, namely, \u201c~T.\u201d We need a different rule to derive that, which we will introduce next. The next form of inference is called \u201cmodus tollens,\u201d which is Latin for \u201cthe way that denies.\u201d Modus tollens has the following form:  1. p \u2283 q 2. ~q 3. \u2234 ~p  What this form says, in words, is that if we have asserted a conditional statement (p \u2283 qand we have also asserted the negated consequent of that conditional (~q), then we are entitled to infer the negated antecedent of that conditional statement (~p). For example, if I asserted the conditional, \u201cif it is raining, then the ground is wet\u201d and I also asserted \u201cthe ground is not wet\u201d (the negated consequent of that conditional) then I am entitled to assert the negated antecedent of the conditional, \u201cit is not raining.\u201d It is important to see that any argument that has this same form is a valid argument. For example, the following argument is also an argument with this same form:  1. C \u2283 (E v F) 2. ~(E v F) 3. \u2234 ~C  In this argument we can assert ~C according to the rule, modus tollens.",
