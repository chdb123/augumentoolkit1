    "How does the absence of a feature relate to its status as a necessary or sufficient condition?",
    "A feature's absence makes it a non-necessary condition; if it's not present when the target is, it can't be required for the target's presence. If it's absent but the target still occurs, it's not a sufficient condition either.",
    "The necessary condition test says that any candidate feature (here A, B, C, or Dthat is absent when the target feature (S) is present is eliminated as a possible necessary condition of S.3 In the table above, A is absent when S is present, so A can\u2019t be a necessary condition (i.e., day 1). D is also absent when S is present (day 4) so D can\u2019t be a necessary condition either. In contrast, B is never absent when S is present\u2014that is every time S is present, B is also present. That means B is a necessary condition, based on the data that we have gathered so far. The same applies to C since it is never absent when S is present. Notice that there are times when both B and C are absent, but on those days the target feature (S) is absent as well, so it doesn\u2019t matter. The next thing we\u2019d want to know is which feature is such that every time it is present, Charlie has a seizure. The test that is relevant to determining this is called the sufficient condition test. The sufficient condition test says that any candidate that is present when the target feature (S) is absent is eliminated as a possible sufficient condition of S. In the table above, we can see that no one candidate feature is a sufficient condition for causing the seizures since for each candidate (A, B, C, D) there is a case (i.e. day) where it is present but that no seizure occurred.",
