    "If dropping matches in water causes them not to light, what does this imply about the relationship between water and fire according to 'Introduction to Logic and Critical Thinking' by Matthew Van Cleave?",
    "This implies that water hinders or prevents fire from occurring when matches are submerged.",
    "If we find that the matches are wet then we can explain the lack of the flame by saying something like, \u201cdropping the matches in the water caused the matches not to light.\u201d In contrast, a sufficient condition is one which, if present, will always bring about the effect. For example, a person being fed through an operating wood chipper is sufficient for causing that person\u2019s death (as was the fate of Steve Buscemi\u2019s character in the movie Fargo). Because the natural world functions in accordance with natural laws (such as the laws of physics), causes can be generalized. For example, any object near the surface of the earth will fall towards the earth at 9.8 m/s2 unless impeded by some contrary force (such as the propulsion of a rocket). This generalization applies to apples, rocks, people, wood chippers and every other object. Such causal generalizations are often parts of explanations. For example, we can explain why the airplane crashed to the ground by citing the causal generalization that all unsupported objects fall to the ground and by noting that the airplane had lost any method of propelling itself because the engines had Chapter 3: Evaluating inductive arguments and probabilistic and statistical fallacies  161 died. So we invoke the causal generalization in explaining why the airplane crashed.",
