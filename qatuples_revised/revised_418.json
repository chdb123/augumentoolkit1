    "'But' represents a conjunction in English.",
    "There is one word in the sentence that tips you off\u2014the \u201cbut.\u201d As we saw earlier, \u201cbut\u201d is a common way of representing a conjunction in English. Thus, we have to conjoin the disjunction (F v Cand the negation (~D). You might think that we could simply conjoin the two propositions like this:  F v C \u22c5 ~D   However, that translation would not be correct, because it is not what we call a well-formed formula. A well-formed formula is a sentence in our symbolic language that has exactly one interpretation or meaning. However, the translation we have given is ambiguous between two different meanings. It could mean that (Noelle will feed the dogs) or (Noelle will clean her room and not do the dishes). That statement would be true if Noelle fed the dogs and also did the dishes. We can represent this possibility symbolically, using parentheses like this:  Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  68  F v (C \u22c5 ~D)  The point of the parentheses is to group the main parts of the sentence together. In this case, we are grouping the \u201cC \u22c5 ~D\u201d together and leaving the \u201cF\u201d by itself. The result is that those groupings are connected by a disjunction, which is the main operator of the sentence. In this case, there are only two groupings: \u201cF\u201d on the one hand, and \u201cC \u22c5 ~D\u201d on the other hand.",
