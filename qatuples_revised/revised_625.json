    "How does the negation of one disjunct lead to the truth of another in a disjunctive syllogism?",
    "If we assert that one part of a disjunction is not true (e.g., Bob did not steal the diamond), then the other part must be true (Linda stole the diamondfor the original disjunction to hold.",
    "In this case, of course, the propositions we are conjoining together are complex, but as long as those propositions have already been asserted as premises in the argument (or derived by some other valid form of inference), we can conjoin them together into a conjunction. The next form of inference we will introduce is called \u201cdisjunctive syllogism\u201d and it has the following form:  1. p v q Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  102 2. ~p 3. \u2234 q  In words, this rule states that if we have asserted a disjunction and we have asserted the negation of one of the disjuncts, then we are entitled to assert the other disjunct. Once you think about it, this inference should be pretty obvious. If we are taking for granted the truth of the premises\u2014that either p or q is true; and that p is not true\u2014then is has to follow that q is true in order for the original disjunction to be true. (Remember that we must assume the premises are true when evaluating whether an argument is valid.If I assert that it is true that either Bob or Linda stole the diamond, and I assert that Bob did not steal the diamond, then it has to follow that Linda did. That is a disjunctive syllogism. As before, any argument that has this same form is a valid argument. For example,  1. ~A v (B \u22c5 C) 2.",
