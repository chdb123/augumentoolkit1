    "What are two conditions necessary for a good statistical generalization?",
    "The two conditions for a good statistical generalization are that the sample should be representative of the population and have an adequate size. This means the characteristics of the sample must match those of the larger population, and the sample should not be biased or skewed in any way. If either condition is not met, the generalization may not accurately reflect the whole population.",
    "If I were to sit on my front porch from 12- 2 pm and count all the cars and trucks that drove down my street, that would be a sample. A good statistical generalization is one in which the sample is representative of the population. When a sample is representative, the characteristics of the sample match the characteristics of the population at large. For example, my method of sampling cars and trucks that drive down my street would be a good method as long as the proportion of trucks to cars that drove down my street between 12-2 pm matched the proportion of trucks to cars that drove down my street during the whole day. If for some reason the number of trucks that drove down my street from 12-2 pm was much higher than the average for the whole day, my sample would not be representative of the Chapter 3: Evaluating inductive arguments and probabilistic and statistical fallacies  142 population I was trying to generalize about (i.e., the total number of cars and trucks that drove down my street in a day). The \u201cadequate sample size\u201d condition and the \u201cnon-biased sample\u201d condition are ways of making sure that a sample is representative. In the rest of this section, we will explain each of these conditions in turn. It is perhaps easiest to illustrate these two conditions by considering what is wrong with statistical generalizations that fail to meet one or more of these conditions. First, consider a case in which the sample size is too small (and thus the adequate sample size condition is not met).",
