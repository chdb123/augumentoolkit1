    "What are the parts of an argument, and what do they consist of?",
    "An argument consists of a premise or multiple premises (statements that support the conclusionand a conclusion (a statement that is supported by the premises).",
    "That is, she has given us a reason for thinking that abortion is morally wrong. The conclusion of the argument is the first four words, \u201cabortion is morally wrong.\u201d But whereas in the first example Sally was simply asserting that abortion is wrong (and then trying to put down those who support it), in this example she is offering a reason for why abortion is wrong. We can (and shouldbe more precise about our definition of an argument. But before we can do that, we need to introduce some further terminology that we will use in our definition. As I\u2019ve already noted, the conclusion of Sally\u2019s argument is that abortion is morally wrong. But the reason for thinking the conclusion is true is what we call the premise. So we have two parts of an argument: the premise and the conclusion. Typically, a conclusion will be supported by two or more premises. Both premises and conclusions are statements. A statement is a type of sentence that can be true or false and Chapter 1: Reconstructing and analyzing arguments  2 corresponds to the grammatical category of a \u201cdeclarative sentence.\u201d For example, the sentence,  The Nile is a river in northeastern Africa   is a statement. Why? Because it makes sense to inquire whether it is true or false. (In this case, it happens to be true.) But a sentence is still a statement even if it is false.",
