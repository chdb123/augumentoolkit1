    "How does a witness's past affect their trustworthiness in court?",
    "A witness's past can be relevant to determining their trustworthiness, as it may indicate whether they are truthful or not.",
    "Not every instance in which someone attacks a person\u2019s character is an ad hominem fallacy. Suppose a witness is on the stand testifying against a defendant in a court of law. When the witness is cross examined by the defense lawyer, the defense lawyer tries to go for the witness\u2019s credibility, perhaps by digging up things about the witness\u2019s past. For example, the defense lawyer may find out that the witness cheated on her taxes five years ago or that the witness failed to pay her parking tickets. The reason this isn\u2019t an ad hominem fallacy is that in this case the lawyer is trying to establish whether what the witness is saying is true or false and in order to determine that we have to know whether the witness is trustworthy. These facts about the witness\u2019s past may be relevant to determining whether we can trust the witness\u2019s word. In this case, the witness is making claims that are either true or false rather than giving an argument. In contrast, when we are assessing someone\u2019s argument, the argument stands on its own in a way the witness\u2019s testimony doesn\u2019t. In assessing an argument, we want to know whether the argument is strong or weak and we can evaluate the argument using the logical techniques surveyed in this text. In contrast, when a witness is giving testimony, they aren\u2019t trying to argue anything. Rather, they are simply making a claim about what did or didn\u2019t happen.",
