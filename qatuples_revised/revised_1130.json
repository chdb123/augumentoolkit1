    "What does it mean for something to 'regress to the mean'?",
    "To regress to the mean means for something to move from an extreme or unusual state back towards a more average or typical state.",
    "Chapter 3: Evaluating inductive arguments and probabilistic and statistical fallacies  185 days, you are all better! No cold! It must have been the medicine. Or maybe you just regressed to the mean. Regression to the mean describes the tendency of things to go back to normal or to return to something close to the relevant statistical average. In the case of a cold, when you have a cold, you are outside of the average in terms of health. But you will naturally return to the state of health, with or without the \u201cmedicine.\u201d If anyone were to try to convince you to buy such a medicine, you shouldn\u2019t. Because the fact that you got better from your cold more likely has to do with the fact that you will naturally regress to the mean (return to normalthan it has to do with the special medicine. Another example. Suppose you live in Lansing and it has been over 100 degrees for two weeks straight. Someone says that if you pay tribute and do a special dance to Baal, the temperature will drop. Suppose you do this and the temperature does drop. Was it Baal or just regression to the mean? Probably regression to the mean, unless we have some special reason for thinking it is Baal. The point is, extreme situations tend to regress towards less extreme, more average situations. Since it is very rare for it to ever be over 100 degrees in Lansing, the fact that the temperature drops is to be expected, regardless of one\u2019s prayers to Baal.",
