    "How does a contradiction differ from a contingent statement?",
    "A contradiction is a statement that is false in virtue of its form and is false in every possible world, while a contingent statement is true or false depending on how the world actually is.",
    "A v (B \u22c5 Cand (A v B) \u22c5 (A v C) 9. (A v B) \u22c5 C and A v (B \u22c5 C)  10. ~(A v B) and ~A v B   2.10 Tautologies, contradictions and contingent statements  Can you think of a statement that could never be false? How about a statement that could never be true? It is harder than you think, unless you know how to utilize the truth functional operators to construct a tautology or a contradiction. A tautology is a statement that is true in virtue of its form. Thus, we don\u2019t even have to know what the statement means to know that it is true. In contrast, a contradiction is a statement that is false in virtue of its form. Finally, a contingent statement is a statement whose truth depends on the way the world actually is. Thus, it is a statement that could be either true or false\u2014it just depends on what the facts actually are. In contrast, there is an important sense in which the truth of a tautology or the falsity of a contradiction doesn\u2019t depend on how the world is. As philosophers would say, tautologies are true in every Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  94 possible world, whereas contradictions are false in every possible world. Consider a statement like:   Matt is either 40 years old or not 40 years old.",
