    "How does the acceptance of society affect the psychological problems faced by children of gay couples, according to the text?",
    "In a non-accepting society, children of gay couples face more teasing, bullying, and lack of acceptance, which could lead to higher rates of psychological problems.",
    "In order to show this, we just have to imagine a scenario in which both the premises are true and yet the conclusion is false. Here is one counterexample to the argument (there are many). Suppose that while it is true that children of gay couples often have psychological and emotional problems, the rate of Chapter 1: Reconstructing and analyzing arguments  29 psychological problems in children raised by gay couples is actually lower than in children raised by heterosexual couples. In this case, even if it were true that the state should always do what it can to decrease harm to children, it does not follow that the state should discourage gay couples from raising children. In fact, in the scenario I\u2019ve described, just the opposite would seem to follow: the state should discourage heterosexual couples from raising children. But even if we suppose that the rate of psychological problems in children of gay couples is higher than in children of heterosexual couples, the conclusion still doesn\u2019t seem to follow. For example, it could be that the reason that children of gay couples have higher rates of psychological problems is that in a society that is not yet accepting of gay couples, children of gay couples will face more teasing, bullying and general lack of acceptance than children of heterosexual couples. If this were true, then the harm to these children isn\u2019t so much due to the fact that their parents are gay as it is to the fact that their community does not accept them.",
