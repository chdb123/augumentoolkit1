    "What is a universal statistical generalization?",
    "A universal statistical generalization asserts that all members of a certain class have a certain feature.",
    "Statistical generalizations are generalizations arrived at by empirical observations of certain regularities. Statistical generalizations can be either universal or partial. Universal generalizations assert that all members (i.e., 100%of a certain class have a certain feature, whereas partial generalizations assert that most or some percentage of members of a class have a certain feature. For example, the claim that \u201c67.5% of all prisoners released from prison are rearrested within three years\u201d is a partial generalization that is much more precise than simply saying that \u201cmost prisoners released from prison are rearrested within three years.\u201d In contrast, the claim that \u201call prisoners released from prison are rearrested within three years\u201d is a universal generalization. As we can see from these examples, deductive arguments typically use universal statistical generalizations whereas inductive arguments typically use partial statistical generalizations. Since statistical generalizations are often crucial premises in both deductive and inductive arguments, being able to evaluate when a statistical generalization is good or bad is crucial for being able to evaluate arguments. What we are doing in evaluating statistical generalizations is determining whether the premise in our argument is true (or at least well- Chapter 3: Evaluating inductive arguments and probabilistic and statistical fallacies  141 supported by the evidence). For example, consider the following inductive argument, whose premise is a (partial) statistical generalization:  1. 70% of voters say they will vote for candidate X 2.",
