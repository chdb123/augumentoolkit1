    "Which principle should you use when explaining why someone claims to see a UFO?",
    "Conservativeness would be the most appropriate principle here, as people don't die and come back to life (as far as we know), so an explanation involving resurrection or other supernatural causes might lack power.

Modesty. There is no reason she should posit all of those specific details about the badger, even if it was a badger. However, even just saying it\u2019s a badger or a large rodent is an explanation that seems to lack simplicity. If houses naturally creak and windows rattle from the wind, then positing a large rodent seems unnecessary. A better explanation would simply be that the house creaks naturally as it slightly shifts and the wind is rattling the windows. 3. Simplicity and modesty. It is simpler to simply assume that there is someone who looks like Bob, whether or not he is Bob\u2019s identical twin. It is also more modest since positing someone who looks like Bob could include someone that is Bob\u2019s identical twin, but also leaves open the possibility that it\u2019s just an unrelated person who happens to look like Bob. The explanation might also lack power insofar as it raises more questions than it answers. For example, why did Bob never tell you about his identical twin? 4.
