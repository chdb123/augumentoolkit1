    "What is the composition fallacy?",
    "The composition fallacy is an error in reasoning where one argues that since each part of the whole has a certain feature, it follows that the whole has that same feature.",
    "4.1.1 Composition fallacy  Consider the following argument:  Each member on the gymnastics team weighs less than 110 lbs. Therefore, the whole gymnastics team weighs less than 110 lbs. Chapter 4: Informal fallacies  189 This arguments commits the composition fallacy. In the composition fallacy one argues that since each part of the whole has a certain feature, it follows that the whole has that same feature. However, you cannot generally identify any argument that moves from statements about parts to statements about wholes as committing the composition fallacy because whether or not there is a fallacy depends on what feature we are attributing to the parts and wholes. Here is an example of an argument that moves from claims about the parts possessing a feature to a claim about the whole possessing that same feature, but doesn\u2019t commit the composition fallacy:  Every part of the car is made of plastic. Therefore, the whole car is made of plastic. This conclusion does follow from the premises; there is no fallacy here. The difference between this argument and the preceding argument (about the gymnastics teamisn\u2019t their form. In fact both arguments have the same form:  Every part of X has the feature f. Therefore, the whole X has the feature f.  And yet one of the arguments is clearly fallacious, while the other isn\u2019t. The difference between the two arguments is not their form, but their content.",
