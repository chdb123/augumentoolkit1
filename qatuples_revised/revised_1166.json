    "How do 'team' and 'worst game played' differ in their applicability to parts?",
    "'Team' applies to all parts if it applies to the whole, while 'worst game played' can apply to the whole even if it does not apply to all parts.",
    "Some concepts (like \u201cteam\u201d and \u201cdying in a plane crash\u201dare such that if they apply to the whole, they also apply to all the parts. Other concepts (like \u201cteam\u201d and \u201cworst game played\u201d) are such that they can apply to the whole even if they do not apply to all the parts. 4.1.3 Begging the question  Consider the following argument:  Capital punishment is justified for crimes such as rape and murder because it is quite legitimate and appropriate for the state to put to death someone who has committed such heinous and inhuman acts. The premise indicator, \u201cbecause\u201d denotes the premise and (derivatively) the conclusion of this argument. In standard form, the argument is this:  1. It is legitimate and appropriate for the state to put to death someone who commits rape or murder. 2. Therefore, capital punishment is justified for crimes such as rape and murder. Chapter 4: Informal fallacies  192 You should notice something peculiar about this argument: the premise is essentially the same claim as the conclusion. The only difference is that the premise spells out what capital punishment means (the state putting criminals to death) whereas the conclusion just refers to capital punishment by name, and the premise uses terms like \u201clegitimate\u201d and \u201cappropriate\u201d whereas the conclusion uses the related term, \u201cjustified.\u201d But these differences don\u2019t add up to any real differences in meaning.",
