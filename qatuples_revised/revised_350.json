    "How does the use of symbolic notation differ from English conjunctions in representing conjunctions?",
    "Symbolic notation (e.g., the dotonly represents that both propositions are true, while English conjunctions often carry more information and context.",
    "Since there is only one row (one possible scenarioin which both p and q are true (i.e., row 1), that is the only circumstance in which the conjunction is true. Since in every other row at least one of the conjuncts is false, the conjunction is false in the remaining three scenarios. At this point, some students will start to lose a handle on what we are doing with truth tables. Often, this is because one thinks the concept is much more complicated than it actually is. (For some, this may stem, in part, from a math phobia that is triggered by the use of symbolic notation.) But a truth table is actually a very simple idea: it is simply a representation of the meaning of a truth-functional operator. When I say that a conjunction is true only if both conjuncts are true, that is just what the table is representing. There is nothing more to it than that. (Later on in this chapter we will use truth tables to prove whether an argument is valid or invalid. Understanding that will require more subtlety, but what I have so far introduced is not complicated at all.) There is more than one way to represent conjunctions in English besides the English word \u201cand.\u201d Below are some common English words and phrases that commonly function as truth-functional conjunctions. It is important to point out that many times English conjunctions carry more information than simply that the two propositions are true (which is the only information carried by our symbolic connective, the dot).",
