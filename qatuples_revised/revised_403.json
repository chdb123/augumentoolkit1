    "We can build a complex sentence using only atomic propositions (C and Gand truth-functional connectives like this: ~C & G, which means \"Bob will not go to class\" and \"Bob will play video games.\"",
    "Clearly, the sentence is asserting two things:  Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  65 Bob will not go to class  Bob will play video games  The first statement is not an atomic proposition, since it contains a negation, \u201cnot.\u201d But the second statement is atomic since it does not contain any truth- functional connectives. So if the first statement is a negation, what is the non- negated, atomic statement? It is this:  Bob will go to class  I will use the constant C to represent this atomic proposition and G to represent the proposition, \u201cBob will play video games.\u201d Now that we have identified our two atomic propositions, how can we build our complex sentence using only those atomic propositions and the truth-functional connectives? Let\u2019s start with the statement \u201cBob will not go to class.\u201d Since we have defined the constant \u201cC\u201d as \u201cBob will go to class\u201d then we can easily represent the statement \u201cBob will not go to class\u201d using a negation, like this:  ~C  The original sentence asserts that, but it is also asserts that Bob will play video games. That is, it is asserting both of these statements. That means we will be connecting \u201c~C\u201d with \u201cG\u201d with the dot operator.",
