    "What is the simpler explanation for the break-ins, according to Matthew Van Cleave?",
    "The simpler explanation is that it was one thief (or a related group of thievesbreaking into the three cars at roughly the same time.",
    "If I were to hypothesize that three separate, unrelated thieves at three different times of the night broke into each of the cars, then this would be an explanation that lacks the virtue of simplicity. The far simpler explanation is that it was one thief (or one related group of thievesthat broke into the three cars at roughly the same time. In the domain of science, upholding simplicity is often a matter of not positing new entities or laws when we can explain the observed facts in terms of existing entities and laws. My earlier example of the sock gnome stealing the socks vs. our dog Violet taking the socks is a good example to illustrate this. Sock gnomes would be a new kind of entity that we don\u2019t have any independent reason to think exists, but our dog Violet clearly already exists and since the observed facts can be explained by Violet\u2019s actions rather than that of a sock gnome, the Violet explanation possesses the explanatory virtue of simplicity, whereas the sock gnome explanation lacks the explanatory virtue of simplicity. However, sometimes science requires that we posit new kinds of entities or Chapter 3: Evaluating inductive arguments and probabilistic and statistical fallacies  152 processes, as when Copernicus and Galileo suggested that the sun, rather than the earth, was at the center of the \u201csolar system\u201d in order to explain certain astronomical observations. In physics new entities are often posited in order to explain the observations that physicists make.",
