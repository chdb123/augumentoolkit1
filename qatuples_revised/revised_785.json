    "How do the premises and conclusion of a categorical syllogism interact in a Venn diagram?",
    "In a Venn diagram for a categorical syllogism, the premises are represented by three circles (one for each type of statement), while the conclusion is represented by two circles. The validity depends on whether they intersect correctly.",
    "As we have seen, there are four different types (formsof categorical statement:   All S are P   (universal affirmative)  No S are P   (universal negative)  Some S are P  (particular affirmative)  Some S are not P  (particular negative)  Thus, any categorical syllogism\u2019s premises and conclusion will be some mixture of these different types of statement. The argument I gave at the beginning of section 2.13 was a categorical syllogism. Here, again, is that argument:  1. All humans are mortal 2. All mortal things die 3. Therefore, all humans die  As we can see now that we have learned the four categorical forms, each one of the statements in this syllogism is a \u201cuniversal affirmative\u201d statement of the form, \u201call S are P.\u201d Let\u2019s first translate each statement of this argument to have the \u201call S are P\u201d form:  1. All humans are things that are mortal. 2. All things that are mortal are things that die. 3. All humans are things that die. In determining the validity of categorical syllogisms, we must construct a three category Venn diagram for the premises and a two category Venn diagram for the conclusion.",
