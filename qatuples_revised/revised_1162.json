    "How do composition and division fallacies differ in their application, as shown by the team examples given?",
    "Composition fallacy occurs when assuming properties of a whole apply to its parts, while division fallacy occurs when assuming properties of parts apply to the whole. In the first example (house), it's wrong to assume each part costs 1 million dollars. In the second example (team), it's right to say each person died in the crash if all did.",
    "This is clearly a fallacy. Just because the whole house costs 1 million dollars, it doesn\u2019t follow that each part of the house costs 1 million dollars. However, here is an argument that has the same form, but that doesn\u2019t commit the division fallacy:  Chapter 4: Informal fallacies  191 The whole team died in the plane crash. Therefore, each individual on the team died in the plane crash. In this example, since we seem to be referring to one plane crash in which all the members of the team died (\u201cthe\u201d plane crash), it follows that if the whole team died in the crash, then every individual on the team died in the crash. So this argument does not commit the division fallacy. In contrast, the following argument has exactly the same form, but does commit the division fallacy:  The team played its worst game ever tonight. Therefore, each individual on the team played their worst game ever tonight. It can be true that the whole team played its worst game ever even if it is true that no individual on the team played their worst game ever. Thus, this argument does commit the fallacy of division even though it has the same form as the previous argument, which doesn\u2019t commit the fallacy of division. This shows (againthat in order to identify informal fallacies (like composition and division), we must rely on our understanding of the concepts involved in the argument.",
