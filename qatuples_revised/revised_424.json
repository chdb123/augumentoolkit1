    "What is the purpose of using parentheses in logical interpretation?",
    "The purpose of using parentheses in logical interpretation is to disambiguate sentences with multiple possibilities or conjunctions, ensuring clarity and accuracy in meaning.",
    "But the original sentence could also mean that (Noelle will feed the dogs or clean her roomand (Noelle will not wash the dishes). In contrast with our earlier interpretation, this interpretation would be false if Noelle fed the dogs and did the dishes, since this interpretation asserts that Noelle will not do the dishes (as part of a conjunction). Here is how we would represent this interpretation symbolically:   (F v C) \u22c5 ~D  Notice that this interpretation, unlike the last one, groups the \u201cF v C\u201d together and leaves the \u201c~D\u201d by itself. These two grouping are then connected by a conjunction, which is the main operator of this complex sentence. The fact that our initial attempt at the translation (without using parentheses) yielded an ambiguous sentence shows the need for parentheses to disambiguate the different possibilities. Since our formal language aims at eliminating all ambiguity, we must choose one of the two groupings as the translation of our original English sentence. So, which grouping accurately captures the original sentence? It is the second translation that accurately captures the meaning of the original English sentence. That sentence clearly asserts that Noelle will not do the dishes and that is what our second translation says. In contrast, the first translation is a sentence that could be true even if Noelle did do the dishes. Given our understanding of the original English sentence, it should not be true under those circumstances since it clearly asserts that Noelle will not do the dishes. Let\u2019s move to a different example.",
