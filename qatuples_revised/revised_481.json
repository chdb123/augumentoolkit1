    "How do reference columns simplify the process of evaluating arguments?",
    "By specifying one of the possible assignments of truth values to the atomic propositions, reference columns allow for a mechanical evaluation of arguments instead of relying on imagination or thinking about different scenarios. This makes it easier and more efficient to determine validity.",
    "In this case, the answer is \u201ctwo,\u201d since there are only two atomic propositions contained in this argument (namely, S and D). Given that there are only two atomic propositions, our truth table will contain only four rows\u2014one row for each possible scenario. There will be one row in which both S and D are true, one row in which both S and D are false, one row in which S is true and D is false, and one row in which S is false and D is true. D S S v D ~S D T T    T F    F T    F F     Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  79 The two furthest left columns are what we call the reference columns of the truth table. Reference columns assign every possible arrangement of truth values to the atomic propositions of the argument (in this case, just D and S). The reference columns capture every logically possible scenario. By doing so, we can replace having to use your imagination to imagine different scenarios (as in the informal test of validitywith a mechanical procedure that doesn\u2019t require us to imagine or even think very much at all. Thus, you can think of each row of the truth table as specifying one of the possible scenarios. That is, each row is one of the possible assignments of truth values to the atomic propositions.",
