    "What are the four atomic propositions mentioned in the sentence?",
    "The four atomic propositions mentioned in the sentence are: B, K, S, T, and W (for washing the dishes).",
    "Consider the sentence:  Either both Bob and Karen are washing the dishes or Sally and Tom are. This sentence contains four atomic propositions: Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  69  Bob is washing the dishes (B Karen is washing the dishes (K)  Sally is washing the dishes (S)  Tom is washing the dishes (T)  As before, I\u2019ve written the constants than I\u2019ll use to stand for each atomic proposition to the right of each atomic proposition. You can use any letter you\u2019d like when coming up with your own translations, as long as each atomic proposition uses a different capital letter. (I typically try to pick letters that are distinctive of each sentence, such as picking \u201cB\u201d for \u201cBob\u201d.) So how can we use the truth functional operators to connect these atomic propositions together to yield a sentence that captures the meaning of the original English sentence?",
