    "How do the validity of the first argument in the text differ from the second one?",
    "The first argument fails because it contains a fallacy; the second one succeeds as its structure allows for the conclusion to follow from its premises. Both arguments have almost the same form, but the first has a hidden assumption that each individual was there at the same time and in their capacity as a team member, which is not necessarily true.",
    "That is, the difference is what feature is being attributed to the parts and wholes. Some features (like weighing a certain amountare such that if they belong to each part, then it does not follow that they belong to the whole. Other features (such as being made of plastic) are such that if they belong to each part, it follows that they belong to the whole. Here is another example:  Every member of the team has been to Paris. Therefore the team has been to Paris. The conclusion of this argument does not follow. Just because each member of the team has been to Paris, it doesn\u2019t follow that the whole team has been to Paris, since it may not have been the case that each individual was there at the same time and was there in their capacity as a member of the team. Thus, even though it is plausible to say that the team is composed of every member of the team, it doesn\u2019t follow that since every member of the team has been to Paris, the whole team has been to Paris. Contrast that example with this one: Chapter 4: Informal fallacies  190  Every member of the team was on the plane. Therefore, the whole team was on the plane. This argument, in contrast to the last one, contains no fallacy. It is true that if every member is on the plane then the whole team is on the plane. And yet these two arguments have almost exactly the same form.",
