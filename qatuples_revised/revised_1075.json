    "What is the Nobel Prize-winning psychologist who suggested a psychological explanation for the conjunction fallacy?",
    "Daniel Kahneman",
    "But option a could also be true even if option b were false (i.e., Mark could have brown hair or red hair, etc.). Thus there are cases where we can easily avoid committing the conjunction fallacy. So what is the difference between this case and the Linda case? The Nobel Prize-winning psychologist, Daniel Kahneman (and his long-time collaborator, Amos Tversky), has for many years suggested a psychological explanation for this difference. The explanation is complex, but I can give you the gist of it quite simply. Kahneman suggests that our minds are wired to find patterns and many of these patterns we find are based on what he calls \u201crepresentativeness.\u201d In the Linda case, the idea of Linda being active in the feminist movement fits better with the description of Linda as a philosophy major, as being active in social justice movements, and, perhaps, as being single. We build up a picture of Linda and then we try to match the descriptions to her. \u201cBank teller\u201d doesn\u2019t really match anything in the description of Linda. That is, the description of Linda is not representative of a bank teller. However, for many people, it is representative of a feminist. Thus, our minds more or less automatically see the match between representativeness of the description of Linda and option b, which mentions she is a feminist.",
