    "How does the causal slippery slope differ from the hypothetical syllogism in terms of probability?",
    "In a hypothetical syllogism, the link between each component is certain, while in a causal slippery slope fallacy, the link between each event is probabilistic.",
    "The causal slippery slope fallacy is actually a formal probabilistic fallacy and so could have been discussed in chapter 3 with the other formal probabilistic fallacies. What makes it a formal rather than informal fallacy is that we can identify it without even having to know what the sentences of the argument mean. I could just have easily written out a nonsense argument comprised of series of probabilistic conditional statements. But I would still have been able to identify the causal slippery slope fallacy because I would have seen that there was a series of probabilistic conditional statements leading to a claim that the conclusion of the series was also probable. That is enough to tell me that there is a causal slippery slope fallacy, even if I don\u2019t really understand the meanings of the conditional statements. It is helpful to contrast the causal slippery slope fallacy with the valid form of inference, hypothetical syllogism. Recall that a hypothetical syllogism has the following kind of form:   A \u2283 B  B \u2283 C  C \u2283 D  D \u2283 E  \u2234 A \u2283 E  Chapter 4: Informal fallacies  201 The only difference between this and the causal slippery slope fallacy is that whereas in the hypothetical syllogism, the link between each component is certain, in a causal slippery slope fallacy, the link between each event is probabilistic.",
