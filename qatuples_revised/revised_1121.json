    "How does our brain's wiring affect our search for causal explanations?",
    "Our brains are wired to look for causal explanations rather than mathematical ones, making us prone to ignore the law of small numbers and seek a causal explanation for phenomena.",
    "The first take home lesson here is that smaller groups will tend to be less representative than larger groups (thus, smaller groups will tend to inhabit the extremely of a spectrum). We can call this the law of small numbers. The second take home message is that our brains are wired to look for causal Chapter 3: Evaluating inductive arguments and probabilistic and statistical fallacies  184 explanations rather than mathematical explanations, and because of this we are prone to ignore the law of small numbers and look for a causal explanation of phenomena instead. The small numbers fallacy is our tendency to seek a causal explanation for some phenomenon when only the law of small numbers is needed to explain that phenomenon. We will end this section with a somewhat humorous and incredible example of a small numbers bias that, presumably, wasted billions of dollars. This example, too, comes from Kahneman, who in turn heard the anecdote from some of his colleagues who are statisticians.11 Some time ago, the Gates foundation (which is the charitable foundation of Microsoft founder, Bill Gatesdonated 1.7 billion to research a curious finding: smaller schools tend to be more successful than larger schools. That is, if you consider a rank ordering of the most successful schools, the smaller schools will tend to be overrepresented near the top (i.e., there is a higher proportion of them near the top of the list compared to the proportion of larger schools at the top of the list).",
