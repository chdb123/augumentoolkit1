    "A tautology is a statement that is always true under all possible interpretations of its variables or premises.",

I had to first determine the left conjunct (A v B) and then the right conjunct (~A \u22c5 ~B), but in order to figure out the truth values of the right conjunct (which is itself a conjunct), I had to determine the negations of A and B. Constructing truth tables can sometimes be a chore, but once you understand what you are doing (and why), it certainly isn\u2019t very difficult. Exercise 15: Construct a truth table to determine whether the following statements are tautologies, contradictions or contingent statements. 1. A \u2283 (A \u22c5 B) 2. (A \u22c5 B) \u2283 (~A \u2283 ~B) 3. (A \u22c5 ~A) \u2283 B 4.",
