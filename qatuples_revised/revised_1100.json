    "What is an example of committing the base rate fallacy in the context of terrorist identification?",
    "Assuming that the chances of someone being a terrorist are 90%, when the actual base rate is less than 1% and the machine's accuracy leads to many false positives. This results in overestimating the likelihood of the person being a terrorist.",
    "The first 30 people pass without triggering a positive identification from the machine, but on the very next person, the machine triggers a positive identification of terrorist intent. The question is: what are the chances that the person who set off the machine really is a terrorist?8 Consider the following three possibilities: a90%, b) 10%, or c) .3%. If you answered 90%, then you committed the base rate fallacy again. The actually answer is \u201cc\u201d\u2014less than 1%! Here\u2019s why. The base rate is the likelihood that any given individual is a terrorist and this is exceedingly low since there is only one terrorist in the building and there are 3000 people in the building. That means the probability of any one person being a terrorist, before any results of the test, is exceedingly low: 1/3000. Since the test is 90% accurate, that means that out of the 2999 non-terrorists, it will misidentify 10% of them as terrorists = ~300 false positives. Assuming the machine doesn\u2019t misidentify the one actual terrorist, the machine will identify a total of 301 individuals as those \u201cpossessing terrorist intent.\u201d The probability that any one of them actually possesses terrorist intent is 1/301 = .3%. So the probability is drastically lower than 90%. It\u2019s not even close.",
