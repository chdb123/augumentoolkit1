    "How can you convert a disjunction into an exclusive or?",
    "To convert a disjunction into an exclusive or, connect each atomic proposition with \"or,\" making explicit which propositions are being compared and that only one can be true at a time. For example: Bob placed first in the race or Bob placed second in the race. This shows that both cannot be true simultaneously.",
    "However, sometimes a disjunction clearly implies that the statement is true only if either one or the other of the disjuncts is true, but not both. For example, suppose that you know that Bob placed either first or second in the race because you remember seeing a picture of him in the paper where he was standing on a podium (and you know that only the top two runners in the race get to stand on the podium). Although you can\u2019t remember which place he was, you know that:  Bob placed either first or second in the race. This is a disjunction that is built out of two different atomic propositions:  Bob placed first in the race  Bob placed second in the race  Although it sounds awkward to write it this way in English, we could simply connect each atomic statement with an \u201cor\u201d:  Bob placed first in the race or Bob placed second in the race. That sentence makes explicit the fact that this statement is a disjunction of two separate statements. However, it is also clear that in this case the disjunction would not be true if all the disjuncts were true, because it is not possible for all the disjuncts to be true, since Bob cannot have placed both first and second. Thus, it is clear in a case such as this, that the \u201cor\u201d is meant as what is called an \u201cexclusive or.\u201d An exclusive or is a disjunction that is true only if one or the other, but not both, of its disjuncts is true.",
