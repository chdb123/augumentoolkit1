    "How can you represent the statement 'cars are man-made' using a Venn diagram?",
    "To represent 'cars are man-made,' create two circles labeled \"cars\" and \"things that are man-made.\" The intersection of these circles would show what is both cars and man-made.",
    "In categorical logic, the capital letters stand for noun phrases that denote categories of things in the world\u2014for example, \u201ccars\u201d or \u201cthings that are man-made\u201d or \u201cmammals\u201d or \u201cthings that are red.\u201d   In categorical logic, we will use what are called Venn diagrams to represent the logical relationships between the different kinds of categorical statements. A Venn diagram is simply a way of graphically representing the logical relationship between two different categorical statements. Below is a Venn diagram that represents the statement, \u201call humans are mortal.\u201d     Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  118 Here is how to understand this Venn. There are two circles that represent the two categories, \u201chumans\u201d and \u201cthings that are mortal.\u201d These two categories are overlapping so that the intersection of those two categories (i.e. the place where the two circles overlaprepresents things that are both human and mortal. Any shaded portions of the Venn diagram (by \u201cshaded\u201d I will mean \u201cblacked out\u201d) represent that there is nothing in that area of the category. So the above Venn says that there is nothing in the category \u201chumans\u201d that is not also in the category \u201cthings that are mortal.\u201d The above Venn also allows that there are things that are in the category \u201cthings that are mortal\u201d but that aren\u2019t in the category \u201chumans\u201d (which is as it should be since, of course, dogs are mortal and yet not human).",
