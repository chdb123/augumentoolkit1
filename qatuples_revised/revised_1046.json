    "The formula for calculating the probability of a disjunction is P(a or b= P(a) + P(b).",
    "Some time later, I was wondering where she did end up going to college, so I did a quick search on her name and, sure enough, she was a freshman at Harvard. No surprise to me. The point of the story is that although we could have said that this woman\u2019s chances of not getting into Harvard are about 94%, this would neglect all the other things about her which in fact drastically increase her chances of getting into Harvard (and thus drastically decrease her chances of not getting in). So our assessments of probability are only as good as the information we use to assess them. If we were omniscient (i.e., all-knowing), then arguably we could know every detail and would be able to predict with 100% accuracy any event. Since we aren\u2019t, we have to rely on the best information we do have and use that information to determine the chances that an event will occur. Calculating the probability of disjunctions is simply a matter of figuring out the probability that either one event or another will occur. To calculate the probability of a disjunction we simply add the probability of the two events together:   P(a or b= P(a) + P(b)  Chapter 3: Evaluating inductive arguments and probabilistic and statistical fallacies  174  For example, suppose I wanted to calculate the probability of drawing randomly from a shuffled deck either a spade or a club.",
