    "How do modus ponens and disjunctive syllogism differ?",
    "Modus ponens is a single-step inference rule that uses an antecedent and consequent of a conditional statement, while disjunctive syllogism compares two premises with a disjunction to derive a conclusion. Both are used in the proof, but they serve different purposes.",
    "That will be the next line of the proof:  11. L v G Addition 10  At this point, our strategy should be to try to derive the other conjunct, \u201c~R\u201d. Notice that \u201c~R\u201d is contained within the sentence on line 4, but it is embedded. How can we \u201cget it free\u201d? Start by noticing that the ~R is a part of a disjunction, which is itself a consequent of a conditional statement. Also notice that we have already derived the antecedent of that conditional statement, which means that we can use modus ponens to derive the consequent:  Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  111 12. ~R v D Modus ponens 4, 10  The penultimate step is to use a disjunctive syllogism to derive \u201c~R\u201d. 13. ~R Disjunctive syllogism 6, 12  The final step is simply to conjoin lines 11 and 13 to get the conclusion:  14. (L v G\u22c5 ~R Conjunction 11, 13  Thus, here is the completed proof:  1. (~A v B) \u2283 L 2. ~B 3. A \u2283 B 4. L \u2283 (~R v D) 5.",
