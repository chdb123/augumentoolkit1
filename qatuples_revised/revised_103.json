    "How does the first premise support the conclusion of the argument?",
    "The first premise supports the conclusion by stating that if the gun was registered to Jeremy, his prints would be expected to be on it, which means they wouldn't necessarily prove he killed Tim.",
    "For example, consider the following argument:  Just because Jeremy\u2019s prints were on the gun that killed Tim and the gun was registered to Jeremy, it doesn\u2019t follow that Jeremy killed Tim since Jeremy\u2019s prints would certainly be on his own gun and someone else could have stolen Jeremy\u2019s gun and used it to kill Tim. What is the conclusion of this argument? (Think about it before reading on.Here is one way of paraphrasing the conclusion:  Chapter 1: Reconstructing and analyzing arguments  16 The fact that Jeremy\u2019s prints were on the gun that killed Tim and the gun was registered to Jeremy doesn\u2019t mean that Jeremy killed Tim. This statement seems to capture the essence of the main conclusion in the above argument. The premises of the argument would be:  1. Jeremy\u2019s prints would be expected to be on a gun that was registered to him 2. Someone could have stolen Jeremy\u2019s gun and then used it to kill Tim  Notice that while I have paraphrased the first premise, I have left the second premise almost exactly as it appeared in the original paragraph. As I\u2019ve said, paraphrases are needed in order to try to make the standard form argument as clear as possible and this is what I\u2019ve tried to do in capturing premise 1 as well as the conclusion of this argument. So here is the reconstructed argument in standard form:  1. Jeremy\u2019s prints would be expected to be on a gun that was registered to him 2.",
