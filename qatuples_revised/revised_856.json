    "What is an example of a bias in a polling questionnaire that could lead to skewed results?",
    "The example provided is a poll about preserving constitutional rights with options 'a' and 'b'. Option 'a' stands for preserving the right, while option 'b' does not.",
    "Before ending this section, we should consider one other source of bias, which is a bias in the polling questionnaire itself (what statisticians call the \u201cinstrument\u201d). Suppose that a poll is trying to determine how much a population favors organic food products. We can imagine the questionnaire containing a choice like the following:   Which do you prefer? a. products that are expensive and have no FDA proven advantage over the less expensive products b. products that are inexpensive and have no FDA proven disadvantage over more expensive products  Because of the phrasing of the options, it seems clear that many people will choose option \u201cb.\u201d Although the two options do accurately describe the difference between organic and non-organic products, option \u201cb\u201d sounds much more desirable than option \u201ca.\u201d The phrasing of the options is biased insofar as \u201ca\u201d is a stand-in for \u201corganic\u201d and \u201cb\u201d is stand-in for \u201cnon-organic.\u201d Even people who favor organic products may be more inclined to choose option \u201cb\u201d here. Thus, the poll would not be representative because the responses would be skewed by the biased phrasing of the options. Here is another example with the same point:  Which do you favor? a. Preserving a citizen\u2019s constitutional right to bear arms b.",
