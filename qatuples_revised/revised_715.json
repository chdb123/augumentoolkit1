    "How does the translation from natural language to propositional logic affect the validity of an argument?",
    "Translating an argument into propositional logic can change its validity. In the given example, the argument appears valid in natural language but invalid in propositional logic.",
    "All humans are mortal 2. All mortal things die 3. Therefore, all humans die  If we were to apply the informal test of validity (from chapter 1to this argument, we would see that the argument is valid because it is not possible to imagine a scenario in which the premises are true and yet the conclusion is false. However, look at what happens if we try to translate it using propositional logic. Since \u201call humans are mortal\u201d is atomic, (i.e., it does not contain any truth functional operators) we can translate it using the constant \u201cH.\u201d The second premise, \u201call mortal things die,\u201d is also atomic, so we can translate it using the constant, \u201cM.\u201d Finally, the conclusion, is yet another atomic statement, \u201cAll humans die,\u201d which we can translate \u201cD.\u201d But then the form of our argument is just this:  1. H 2. M 3. \u2234 D  The problem is that this argument is not valid, which we can clearly see by constructing a truth table. Since there are three different atomic components, our truth table will be 8 rows. (In the following truth table, since the reference columns would just be identical to the premise and conclusion columns, I just collapsed the two in order to make the truth table less redundant.)",
