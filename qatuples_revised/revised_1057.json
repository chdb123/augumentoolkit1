    "What is the difference between calculating the chances of drawing a flush in a specific suit and calculating the chances of drawing a flush in any suit?",
    "Calculating the chances of drawing a flush in a specific suit involves finding the probability of one event occurring (e.g., drawing a heart flush), while calculating the chances of drawing a flush in any suit involves finding the probability of any flush occurring, which requires considering all suits (hearts, spades, diamonds, and clubs). This is done by adding their individual probabilities. In this case, it would be .05% + .05% + .05%.",
    "That is a conjunction of different events. As you can also see, the probability of drawing such a hand is extremely low\u2014about .0005 or .05%. A flush is indeed a rare hand. But suppose we wanted to know, not the chances of drawing a flush in a specific suit, but just the chances of drawing a flush in any suit. In that case, we\u2019d have to calculate the probability of a disjunction of drawing either a flush in clubs or a flush in spades or a flush in diamonds or a flush in hearts. Recall that in order to calculate a disjunction we must add together the probabilities:   .0005 + .0005 + .0005 + .0005 = .002  So the probability of drawing a flush in any suit is still only about .2% or one fifth of one percent\u2014i.e., very low. Chapter 3: Evaluating inductive arguments and probabilistic and statistical fallacies  175 Let\u2019s examine another example before closing this section on probability. Suppose we want to know the chances of flipping at least 1 head in 6 flips of a fair coin. You might reason as follows: There is a 50% chance I flip heads on the first flip, a 50% chance on the second, etc.",
