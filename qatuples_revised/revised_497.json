    "What is the formula to determine the number of rows in a truth table for arguments with n atomic propositions?",
    "The formula is 2n, where n is the number of atomic propositions.",
    "The first thing to recognize about this argument is that there are three atomic propositions, A, B, and C. And that means our truth table will have 8 rows instead of only 4 rows like our last truth table. The reason we need 8 rows is that it takes twice as many rows to represent every logically possible scenario when we are working with three different propositions. Here is a simple formula that you can use to determine how many rows your truth table needs:   2n (where n is the number of atomic propositions You read this formula \u201ctwo to the n-th power.\u201d So if you have one atomic proposition (as in the truth table for negation), your truth table will have only two rows. If you have two atomic propositions, it will have four rows. If you have three atomic propositions, it will have 8 rows. The number of rows needed grows exponentially as the number of atomic propositions grows linearly. The table below represents the same relationship that the above formula does:      Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  82           So, our truth table for the above argument needs to have 8 rows.",
