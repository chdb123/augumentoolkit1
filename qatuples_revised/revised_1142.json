    "What makes an argument invalid in terms of its form?",
    "An argument is invalid if it does not follow the rules of inference like modus ponens or modus tollens.",
    "The fact is, each flip is independent of the next, so the fact that I have just flipped 4 heads in a row does not increase or decrease my chances of flipping a head. Likewise for Erik. It is true that as long as the coin is fair, then over a large number of flips we should expect that the proportion of heads to tails will be about 50/50. But there is no reason to expect that a particular flip will be more likely to be one or the other. Since the coin is fair, each flip has the same probability of being heads and the same probability of being tails\u201450%. Chapter 4: Informal fallacies  187 4.1 Formal vs. informal fallacies  A fallacy is simply a mistake in reasoning. Some fallacies are formal and some are informal. In chapter 2, we saw that we could define validity formally and thus could determine whether an argument was valid or invalid without even having to know or understand what the argument was about. We saw that we could define certain valid rules of inference, such as modus ponens and modus tollens. These inference patterns are valid in virtue of their form, not their content. That is, any argument that has the same form as modus ponens or modus tollens will automatically be valid. A formal fallacy is simply an argument whose form is invalid. Thus, any argument that has that form will automatically be invalid, regardless of the meaning of the sentences.",
