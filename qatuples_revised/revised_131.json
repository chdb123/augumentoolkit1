    "What does it mean for an argument to be invalid?",
    "An invalid argument is one in which it is possible to imagine a scenario where the premise is true and yet the conclusion is false.",
    "It will help to better understand the concept of validity by applying the informal test of validity to some sample arguments. 2 As it happens, Ford wasn\u2019t elected Vice President either since he was confirmed by the Senate, under the twenty fifth amendment, after Spiro Agnew resigned. So Ford wasn\u2019t ever elected by the Electoral College\u2014as either Vice President or President. Chapter 1: Reconstructing and analyzing arguments  20  1. Joan jumped out of an airplane without a parachute 2. Therefore, Joan fell to her death (from 1 To apply the informal test of validity we have to ask whether it is possible to imagine a scenario in which the premise is true and yet the conclusion is false (if so, the argument is invalid). So, can we imagine a world in which someone jumped out of an airplane without a parachute and yet did not fall to her death? (Think about it carefully before reading on.) As we will see, applying the informal test of validity takes some creativity, but it seems clearly possible that Joan could jump out of an airplane without a parachute and not die\u2014she could be perfectly fine, in fact. All we have to imagine is that the airplane was not operating and in fact was on the ground when Joan jumped out of it. If that were the case, it would be a) true that Joan jumped out of an airplane without a parachute and yet b) false that Joan fell to her death.",
