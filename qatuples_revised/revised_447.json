    "How does the negation operator affect the symbolic translation of \"not both p and q\"?",
    "The negation applies to everything inside the parentheses, so ~(p \u22c5 qtranslates to \"not both p and q.\"",
    "Let\u2019s apply this to the \u201cnot both\u201d statement (which we first saw back in the beginning of section 2.4). There are four possible scenarios, and the statement would be true in every one except the first scenario:  Carla has cake Carla has ice cream False Carla has cake Carla does not have ice cream True Carla does not have cake Carla has ice cream True Carla does not have cake Carla does not have ice cream True  To say that Carla will not have both cake and ice cream allows that she can have one or the other (just not both). It also allows that she can have neither (as in the fourth scenario). So the way to think about the \u201cnot both\u201d locution is as a negation of a conjunction, since the conjunction is the only scenario that cannot be true if the statement is true. If we use the constant \u201cC\u201d to represent the atomic sentence, \u201cCarla has cake,\u201d and \u201cI\u201d to represent \u201cCarla has ice cream,\u201d then the resulting symbolic translation would be:   ~(C \u22c5 I Thus, in general, statements of the form \u201cnot both p and q\u201d will be translated as the negation of a conjunction:   ~(p \u22c5 q)  Note that the main operator of the statement is the negation. The negation applies to everything inside the parentheses\u2014i.e., to the conjunction.",
