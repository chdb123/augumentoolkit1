    "What is the symbol for 'material conditional'?",
    "The symbol for 'material conditional' is the horseshoe, represented by \u2283.",
    "Let\u2019s symbolize \u201cit is raining\u201d as \u201cR\u201d and \u201cthe ground is wet\u201d as \u201cG.\u201d  Thus, our symbolization of the above conditional would be:   R \u2283 G  The \u201c\u2283\u201d symbol is called the \u201chorseshoe\u201d and it represents what is called the \u201cmaterial conditional.\u201d A material conditional is defined as being true in every case except when the antecedent is true and the consequent is false. Below is the truth table for the material conditional. Notice that, as just stated, there is only one scenario in which we count the conditional false: when the antecedent is true and the consequent false. p q p \u2283 q T T T T F F F T T F F T  Let\u2019s see how this applies to the above conditional, \u201cif it is raining, then the ground is wet.\u201d As before, we can think about the meaning of the truth functional connectives by asking whether the sentences containing those connectives would be true or false in the four possible scenarios. The first two are pretty easy. If I assert the above conditional \u201cif it is raining then the ground is wet\u201d when it is both raining and the ground is wet (i.e., the first line of the truth table below), then the conditional statement would be true in that scenario.",
