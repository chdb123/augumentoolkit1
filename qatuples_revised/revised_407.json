    "How do ~C and ~(C \u22c5 G) differ in their meanings, according to the text?",
    "~C means \"It is not the case that Bob goes to class,\" while ~(C \u22c5 Gmeans \"It is not the case that Bob plays video games or does both.\"",
    "Since we have already assigned \u201cG\u201d to the statement \u201cBob will play video games,\u201d the resulting translation should look like this:  ~C \u22c5 G  Although sometimes we can translate sentences into our symbolic language without the use of parentheses (as we did in the previous example), many times a translation will require the use of parentheses. For example:   Bob will not both go to class and play video games. Notice that whereas the earlier sentence asserted that Bob will not go to class, this sentence does not. Rather, it asserts that Bob will not do both things (i.e., go to class and play video games), but only one or the other (and possibly neither). That is, this sentence does not tell us for sure that Bob will/won\u2019t go to Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  66 class or that he will/won\u2019t play video games, but only that he won\u2019t do both of these things. Using the same translations as before, how would we translate this sentence? It should be clear that we cannot use the same translation as before since these two sentences are not saying the same thing. Thus, we cannot use the translation:   ~C \u22c5 G  since that translation says for sure that Bob will not go to class and that he will play video games. Thus, our translation must be different. Here is how to translate the sentence:   ~(C \u22c5 G I have here introduced some new symbols, the parentheses.",
