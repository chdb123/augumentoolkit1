    "What is the difference between a proposition and a conjunction in logic?",
    "A proposition is an individual statement, while a conjunction is a combination of two or more propositions.",
    "For example,  1. (A v B\u22c5 ~(C \u22c5 D) 2. \u2234 (A v B)  is a valid inference because it has the same form as simplification. That is, line 1 is a conjunction (since the dot is the main operator of the sentence) and line 2 is inferring one of the conjuncts of that conjunction in line 1. (Just think of the \u201cA v B\u201d as the \u201cp\u201d and the \u201c~(C \u22c5 D)\u201d as the \u201cq\u201d.) The next rule we will introduce is called \u201cconjunction\u201d and is like the reverse of simplification. (Don\u2019t confuse the rule called conjunction with the type of complex proposition called a conjunction.) Conjunction has the following form:  1. p 2. q 3. \u2234 p \u22c5 q  What this rule says, in words, is that if you have asserted two different propositions, then you are entitled to assert the conjunction of those two propositions. As before, it is important to realize that any inference that has the same form as conjunction is a valid inference. For example,  1. A \u2283 B 2. C v D 3. \u2234 (A \u2283 B) \u22c5 (C v D)  is a valid inference because it has the same form as conjunction. We are simply conjoining two propositions together; it doesn\u2019t matter whether those propositions are atomic or complex.",
