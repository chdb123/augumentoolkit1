    "Suppose you counted all the cars on your street for three hours during rush hour instead of a weekday; how would that affect the representativeness of your sample?",
    "Counting cars during rush hour would result in a biased sample, as it might overrepresent trucks. The sample would not be representative because it doesn't account for all types of cars or times of day.",
    "For example, Jones and Smith are talking about the relative quality of Fords versus Chevys and Jones tells Smith about his uncle\u2019s Ford, which broke down numerous times within the first year of owning it. Jones then says that Fords are just unreliable and that that is why he would never buy one. The generalization, which is here ambiguous between a universal generalization (i.e., all Fords are unreliableand a partial generalization (i.e., most/many Fords are unreliable), is not supported by just one case, however convinced Smith might be after hearing the anecdote about Jones\u2019s uncle\u2019s Ford. The non-biased sample condition may not be met even when the adequate sample size condition is met. For example, suppose that I count all the cars on my street for a three hour period from 11-2 pm during a weekday. Let\u2019s assume Chapter 3: Evaluating inductive arguments and probabilistic and statistical fallacies  143 that counting for three hours straight give us an adequate sample size. However, suppose that during those hours (lunch hours) there is a much higher proportion of trucks to cars, since (let\u2019s suppose) many work trucks are coming to and from worksites during those lunch hours. If that were the case, then my sample, although large enough, would not be representative because it would be biased.",
