    "How does the independence of propositions relate to the truth value of their conjunction?",
    "If two propositions are independent, then the truth value of their conjunction depends solely on the combined truth values of each proposition; if they are not independent, the conjunction is not truth-functional.",
    "Unlike the previous example, in this case we can clearly identify two propositions whose truth values are independent of each other:   Maya is a woman  Alice is a woman  Whether or not Maya is a woman is an issue that is totally independent of whether Alice is a woman (and vice versa). That is, the fact that Maya is a woman tells us nothing about whether Alice is a woman. In contrast, the fact that Maya is married to Alice implies that Alice is married to Maya. So the way to determine whether or not a conjunction is truth-functional is to ask whether it is formed from two propositions whose truth is independent of each other. If there are two propositions whose truth is independent of each other, then the conjunction is truth-functional; if there are not two propositions whose truth is independent of each other, the conjunction is not truth-functional. Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  58  Exercise 8: Identify which of the following sentences are truth-functional conjunctions. If the sentence is a truth-functional conjunction, identify the two conjuncts (by writing them down). 1. Jack and Jill are coworkers. 2. Tom is a fireman and a father. 3. Ringo Starr and John Lennon were bandmates. 4. Lucy loves steak and onion sandwiches. 5. Cameron Dias has had several relationships, although she has never married. 6.",
