    "What is an alternative way to express a conditional statement in English?",
    "An alternative way to express a conditional statement in English is \"if...then.\" For example, \"If you study hard, you will pass the exam.\" This means that studying hard is sufficient for passing the exam but not necessary.",
    "How about if you don\u2019t pass all the exams and yet you do pass the course (third row)? My statement allows this to be true and it is important to see why. When I assert E \u2283 C I am not asserting anything about the situation in which E is false. I am simply saying that one way of passing the course is by passing all of the exams; but that doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t other ways of passing the course. Finally, consider the case in which you do not pass all the exams and you also do not pass the course (fourth row). For the same reason, this scenario is compatible with my statement being true. Thus, again, we see that a material conditional is false in only one circumstance: when the antecedent is true and the consequent is false. There are other English phrases that are commonly used to express conditional statements.",
