    "How could you apply the seven explanatory virtues to determine if the hypothesis 'a rock thrown from a lawnmower broke your car window' is valid?",
    "To apply the seven explanatory virtues, check if the hypothesis explains all observed facts (explanatoriness), doesn't raise more questions than it answers (depth), applies in various contexts (power), can be falsified (falsifiability), and claims no more than needed to explain the facts (modesty). The baseball-dog hypothesis would be a better explanation, as it accounts for both the broken window and missing iPod.",
    "For example, Chapter 3: Evaluating inductive arguments and probabilistic and statistical fallacies  149 if, in order to explain the facts that your car window was broken and your iPod was missing, someone were to say offer the hypothesis that a rock thrown up from a lawnmower broke the window of your car, then this hypothesis wouldn\u2019t account for all the facts because it wouldn\u2019t explain the disappearance of your iPod. It would lack the explanatory virtue of explaining all the observed facts. The baseball-dog hypothesis would explain all the observed facts, but it would lack certain other explanatory virtues, such as \u201cpower\u201d and \u201csimplicity.\u201d In the remainder of this section, I will list the seven explanatory virtues and then I will discuss each one in turn. The seven explanatory virtues are:  1. Explanatoriness: Explanations must explain all the observed facts. 2. Depth: Explanations should not raise more questions than they answer. 3. Power: Explanations should apply in a range of similar contexts, not just the current situation in which the explanation is being offered. 4. Falsifiability: Explanations should be falsifiable\u2014it must be possible for there to be evidence that would show that the explanation is incorrect. 5. Modesty: Explanations should not claim any more than is needed to explain the observed facts. Any details in the explanation must relate to explaining one of the observed facts. 6.",
