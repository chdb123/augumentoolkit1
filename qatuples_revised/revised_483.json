    "How do the truth values in row 1 and row 4 compare, given the premises 'S v D' and 'D'?",
    "In row 1, both S and D are true, so S v D is also true; in row 4, D is false, making S v D false.",
    "For example, row 1 of the truth table (the first row after the header rowis a scenario in which it is true that the convict escaped by hiding out in the back of the delivery van, and is also true that the convict escaped by crawling through the sewage pipes. In contrast, row 4 is a scenario in which the convict did neither of these things. The next thing we need to do is figure out what the truth values of the premises and conclusion are for each row of the truth table. We are able to determine what those truth values are because we understand how the truth value of the compound proposition depends on the truth value of the atomic propositions. Given the meanings of the truth functional connectives (discussed in previous sections), we can fill out our truth table like this:  D S S v D ~S D T T T F T T F T T T F T T F F F F F T F  To determine the truth values for the first premise of the argument (\u201cS v D\u201d) we just have to know the truth values of S and D and the meaning of the truth functional connective, the disjunction. The truth table for the disjunction says that a disjunction is true as long as at least one of its disjuncts is true.",
