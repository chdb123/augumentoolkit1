    "In formal logic, 'formal' refers to using constants and truth functional connectives to represent arguments.",
    "Construct proofs to prove an argument is valid  It is important to reiterate that truth tables are the only formal method that allow us to determine whether an argument is valid or invalid; proofs can only show that an argument is valid, but not that it is invalid. You might think that you can use proofs to show that an argument is invalid\u2014for example, if you are unable to construct a proof for an argument, that means that the argument is invalid. However, this doesn\u2019t follow. There could be many reasons why you are unable to construct a proof, including that you just aren\u2019t skilled enough to construct proofs. But the fact that you aren\u2019t skilled enough to find a proof for an argument wouldn\u2019t mean that the argument is invalid, it would just mean that you weren\u2019t skilled enough to show that it is valid! So we cannot use one\u2019s inability to construct a proof for an argument to establish that the argument is invalid. Again, only the truth table test of validity can establish that an argument is invalid. The study of propositional logic has given us a way of understanding what \u201cformal\u201d means in the phrase, \u201cformal logic.\u201d We can see this clearly with the truth table test of validity. After we translate an argument into propositional Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  114 logic using constants and the truth functional connectives, we don\u2019t need to know what the constants mean in order to know whether the argument is valid or invalid.",
