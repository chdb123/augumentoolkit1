    "What happens to the truth values of S and D when one is true and the other is false in a truth table with only two atomic propositions?",
    "When one is true and the other is false, it depends on which one is true and which is false. If S is true and D is false, then T will be false; if D is true and S is false, then T will be true.",
    "In this case, the answer is \u201ctwo,\u201d since there are only two atomic propositions contained in this argument (namely, S and D). Given that there are only two atomic propositions, our truth table will contain only four rows\u2014one row for each possible scenario. There will be one row in which both S and D are true, one row in which both S and D are false, one row in which S is true and D is false, and one row in which S is false and D is true.

Reference columns assign every possible arrangement of truth values to the atomic propositions of the argument (in this case, just D and S). The reference columns capture every logically possible scenario. By doing so, we can replace having to use your imagination to imagine different scenarios (as in the informal test of validitywith a mechanical procedure that doesn\u2019t require us to imagine or even think very much at all. Thus, you can think of each row of the truth table as specifying one of the possible scenarios. That is, each row is one of the possible assignments of truth values to the atomic propositions.",
