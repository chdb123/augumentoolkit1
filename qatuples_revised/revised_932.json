    "How do Bob's and the woman's hypotheses relate to each other?",
    "Both characters make hypotheses about their own immortality based on surviving events they deem improbable, with the woman hypothesizing about rats and Bob hypothesizing about himself.",
    "She hypothesizes that the rats must be a new breed of rats that are immortal and that evolved in the environment of her apartment. 15. Bob is fed up with his life. He intends to kill himself so he gets his gun, puts bullets into it and pull the trigger. Miraculously, he is not killed. Bob hypothesizes that he must be immortal. Chapter 3: Evaluating inductive arguments and probabilistic and statistical fallacies  155   3.3 Analogical arguments  Another kind of common inductive argument is an argument from analogy. In an argument from analogy, we note that since some thing x shares similar properties to some thing y, then since y has characteristic A, x probably has characteristic A as well. For example, suppose that I have always owned Subaru cars in the past and that they have always been reliable and I argue that the new car I\u2019ve just purchased will also be reliable because it is a Subaru. The two things in the analogy are 1the Subarus I have owned in the past and 2) the current Subaru I have just purchased. The similarity between these two things is just that they are both Subarus. Finally, the conclusion of the argument is that this Subaru will share the characteristic of being reliable with the past Subarus I have owned. Is this argument a strong or weak inductive argument? Partly it depends on how many Subarus I\u2019ve owned in the past.",
