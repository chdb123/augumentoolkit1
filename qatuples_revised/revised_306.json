    "What are the four steps leading to U.S. troops facing chemical weapons on the battlefield if we don't respond to Assad's use?",
    "If we don\u2019t respond to Assad\u2019s use of chemical weapons, then Assad\u2019s regime will continue using them with impunity (1). This will effectively erode the ban on chemical weapons (2). If the ban on chemical weapons erodes, other tyrants will be more likely to attain and use them (3). Other tyrants attaining and using chemical weapons will make U.S. troops more likely to face them on the battlefield (4).",
    "If we don\u2019t respond to Assad\u2019s use of chemical weapons, then Assad\u2019s regime will continue using them with impunity. 2. If Assad\u2019s regime uses chemical weapons with impunity, this will effectively erode the ban on them. 3. If the ban on chemical weapons erodes, then other tyrants will be more likely to attain and use them. 4. If other tyrants attain and use chemical weapons, U.S. troops will be more likely to face chemical weapons on the battlefield. 5. Therefore, if we don\u2019t respond to Assad\u2019s use of chemical weapons, U.S. troops will be more likely to face chemical weapons on the battlefield. (from 1-46. If we don\u2019t respond to Assad\u2019s use of chemical weapons and if fighting spills beyond Syrian borders, our allies could face these chemical weapons. 7. If Assad\u2019s regime uses chemical weapons with impunity, it will weaken prohibitions on other weapons of mass destruction. 8. If prohibitions on other weapons of mass destruction are weakened, this will embolden Assad\u2019s ally, Iran, to develop a nuclear program. 9. Therefore, if we don\u2019t respond to Assad\u2019s use of chemical weapons, this will embolden Assad\u2019s ally, Iran, to develop a nuclear program. (from 1, 7-8) 10.",
