    "How does the example of Melissa's argument about doctors support for abortion demonstrate an appeal to consequences fallacy?",
    "Melissa argues that since some other group of doctors supported abortion, it must be morally acceptable. However, doctors are not authorities on moral issues, so their opinions are irrelevant in this case.",
    "It would be just as much an appeal to consequences fallacy if Melissa were to argue that since some other group of doctors supported abortion, that shows that it must be morally acceptable. In either case, since doctors are not authorities on moral issues, their opinions on a moral issue like abortion is irrelevant. In general, an appeal to authority fallacy occurs when someone takes what an individual says as evidence for some claim, when that individual has no particular expertise in the relevant domain (even if they do have expertise in some other, unrelated, domain).
