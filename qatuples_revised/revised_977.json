    "What is the form of a causal generalization?",
    "The form of a causal generalization is For any x, if x has the feature(sF, then x has the feature G.",
    "Causal generalizations have a particular form:   For any x, if x has the feature(sF, then x has the feature G  For example:   For any human, if that human has been fed through an operating wood chipper, then that human is dead. For any engine, if that engine has no fuel, then that engine will not operate. For any object near the surface of the earth, if that object is unsupported and not impeded by some contrary force, then that object will fall towards the earth at 9.8 m/s2. Being able to determine when causal generalizations are true is an important part of becoming a critical thinker. Since in both scientific and every day contexts we rely on causal generalizations in explaining and understanding our world, the ability to assess when a causal generalization is true is an important skill. For example, suppose that we are trying to figure out what causes our dog, Charlie, to have seizures. To simplify, let\u2019s suppose that we have a set of potential candidates for what causes his seizures. It could be either:   A) eating human food,  B) the shampoo we use to wash him,  C) his flea treatment,  D) not eating at regular intervals,   or some combination of these things. Suppose we keep a log of when these things occur each day and when his seizures (S) occur. In the table below, I will represent the absence of the feature by a negation.",
