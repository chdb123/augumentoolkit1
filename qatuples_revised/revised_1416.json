    "What is a disanalogy, as described in Exercise 4 of Introduction to Logic and Critical Thinking by Matthew Van Cleave?",
    "A disanalogy is a comparison between two things that are similar in some ways but differ significantly in others, making the conclusion invalid or unsupported by evidence. In this case, assuming a painting hanging in a high school is not a Rembrandt because it's similar to those in galleries.",
    "This would violate what we know about how evolution works (i.e., we probably need a much larger population for this to happen than the population of rats that are contained in only her apartment). Furthermore, the explanation lacks power since a better explanation that applied to a wider range of circumstances is simply that the rats were not taking the bait. 14. Even more clearly than #13, this one lacks conservativeness. There are no known cases of anything being immortal and this idea violates our understanding of the basic laws of nature. Nothing is immortal. 15. Again, this explanation lacks conservativeness (i.e., it violates our understanding of nature which says that nothing is immortal). A better explanation is that the bullets Bob put in his gun were blanks (cf. the movie, Crash). Exercise 24 Answers to exercises  232 1. Weak: if the painting is hanging in your high school, it probably isn\u2019t a Rembrandt. That is the disanalogy: even if the colors are very similar, almost all Rembrandts hang in galleries, not in high schools. 2. Weak. Although the similarity is that they are both poodles, there is probably some other characteristic that accounted for me being bitten. That is, it probably wasn\u2019t the fact that the dog that bit me was a poodle, but more likely that I was invading its space or it felt threatened, etc.",
