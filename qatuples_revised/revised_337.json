    "What is the form of a conjunction according to Matthew Van Cleave?",
    "The form of a conjunction, as per Matthew Van Cleave, is \"p and q.\" This means that both conjuncts must be true for the conjunction to be true.",
    "If Bob and Sally split chores and Bob\u2019s chore was to both vacuum and dust whereas Sally\u2019s chore was to both mop and do the dishes, then if Sally said she mopped the floor and did the dishes when in reality she only did the dishes (but did not mop the floor), then Bob could rightly complain that it isn\u2019t true that Sally both mopped the floor and did the dishes! What this shows is that conjunctions are true only if both conjuncts are true. This is true of all conjunctions. The conjunction above has a certain form\u2014the same form as any conjunction. We can represent that form using placeholders\u2014 lowercase letters like p and q to stand for any statement whatsoever. Thus, we represent the form of a conjunction like this:  p and q  Any conjunction has this same form. For example, the complex proposition, \u201cit is sunny and hot today,\u201d has this same form which we can see by writing the conjunction this way:   It is sunny today and it is hot today. Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  54 Although we could write the conjunction that way, it is more natural in English to conjoin the adjectives \u201csunny\u201d and \u201chot\u201d to get \u201cit is sunny and hot today.\u201d  Nevertheless, these two sentences mean the same thing (it\u2019s just that one sounds more natural in English than the other).",
