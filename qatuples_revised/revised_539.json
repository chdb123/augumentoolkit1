    "How can you pass a course without passing all exams, according to the text?",
    "You can pass a course by fulfilling other requirements besides passing all exams, which may include extra credit or making up for failed exams.",
    "How about if you don\u2019t pass all the exams and yet you do pass the course (third row)? My statement allows this to be true and it is important to see why. When I assert E \u2283 C I am not asserting anything about the situation in which E is false. I am simply saying that one way of passing the course is by passing all of the exams; but that doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t other ways of passing the course. Finally, consider the case in which you do not pass all the exams and you also do not pass the course (fourth row). For the same reason, this scenario is compatible with my statement being true. Thus, again, we see that a material conditional is false in only one circumstance: when the antecedent is true and the consequent is false. There are other English phrases that are commonly used to express conditional statements.",
