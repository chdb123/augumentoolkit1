    "Using the substitution test from the text, is 'Bob-the-arsonist has been dead for a year, so Bob-the-arson didn't set the fire at the East Lansing Starbucks last week' an argument?",
    "Yes, using the substitution test, this sentence becomes \"It follows that Bob-the-arson didn't set the fire at the East Lansing Starbucks last week,\" which still makes sense and is an argument. The premise is \"Bob-the-arson has been dead for a year.\"",
    "Thus, if \u201csince\u201d were really functioning as a premise indicator in the above example then what followed it would be a statement. But \u201c1999\u201d is not a statement at all. Likewise, in the second example \u201cso\u201d is not being used as a conclusion indicator because it is not conjoining two separate statements. Rather, it is being used to modify the extent of \u201chappy.\u201d In contrast, if I were to say \u201cTom was sleeping, so he couldn\u2019t have answered the phone,\u201d then \u201cso\u201d is being used as a conclusion indicator. In this case, there are clearly two separate statements (\u201cTom was sleeping\u201d and \u201cTom couldn\u2019t have answered the phone\u201dand one is being used as the basis for thinking that the other is true. If there is any doubt about whether a word is truly a premise/conclusion indicator or not, you can use the substitution test. Simply substitute another word or phrase from the list of premise indicators or conclusion indicators and see if the resulting sentence still makes sense. If it does, then you are probably dealing with an argument. If it doesn\u2019t, then you probably aren\u2019t. For example, we can substitute \u201cit follows that\u201d for \u201cso\u201d in the Bob-the-arsonist example:  Bob-the-arsonist has been dead for a year, it follows that Bob-the-arsonist didn\u2019t set the fire at the East Lansing Starbucks last week.",
