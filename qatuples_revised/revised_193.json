    "What is an analogy, and how can it be used to strengthen an argument?",
    "An analogy is a comparison between two things that share some similarities to help understand one thing better. It can strengthen an argument by providing context or showing the logic behind the claim. In this case, the analogy shows that discouraging gay couples from raising children would be unjust if their problems are due to societal factors rather than their orientation.",
    "In that case, the state should not necessarily discourage gay couples from raising children. Here is an analogy: At one point in our country\u2019s history (if not still todayit is plausible that the children of black Americans suffered more psychologically and emotionally than the children of white Americans. But for the government to discourage black Americans from raising children would have been unjust, since it is likely that if there was a higher incidence of psychological and emotional problems in black Americans, then it was due to unjust and unequal conditions, not to the black parents, per se. So, to return to our example, the state should only discourage gay couples from raising children if they know that the higher incidence of psychological problems in children of gay couples isn\u2019t the result of any kind of injustice, but is due to the simple fact that the parents are gay. Thus, one way of making the argument (at least closer to) valid would be to add the following two missing premises:  A. The rate of psychological problems in children of gay couples is higher than in children of heterosexual couples. B. The higher incidence of psychological problems in children of gay couples is not due to any kind of injustice in society, but to the fact that the parents are gay. So the reconstructed standard form argument would look like this:  Chapter 1: Reconstructing and analyzing arguments  30 1. Children who are raised by gay couples often have psychological and emotional problems. 2.",
