    "How can you use rule 8 ('H \u22c5 K') to prove 'L' from 'K \u2283 (H v R)'?",
    "Apply rule 8: H \u22c5 K, then apply rule 5: L. This gives you H v R, and using rules 1 and 3, you can derive L.",

The goal of the game is to derive the conclusion from the given premises using only the 8 valid rules of inference that we have introduced. Not every proof requires you to use every rule, of course. But you may use any of the rules\u2014as along as your use of the rule is correct. Like most games, people can be better or worse at the \u201cgame\u201d of constructing proofs.",
