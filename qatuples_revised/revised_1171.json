    "What is circular reasoning and how does it differ from begging the question?",
    "Circular reasoning is a broader term that refers to arguments where the conclusion is derived from the premises but also used to support them. Begging the question is a specific type of circular reasoning where the premise assumes the truth of the conclusion.",
    "Thus, the premise is essentially saying the same thing as the conclusion. This is a problem: we want our premise to provide a reason for accepting the conclusion. But if the premise is the same claim as the conclusion, then it can\u2019t possibly provide a reason for accepting the conclusion! Begging the question occurs when one (either explicitly or implicitlyassumes the truth of the conclusion in one or more of the premises. Begging the question is thus a kind of circular reasoning. One interesting feature of this fallacy is that formally there is nothing wrong with arguments of this form. Here is what I mean. Consider an argument that explicitly commits the fallacy of begging the question. For example,  1. Capital punishment is morally permissible 2. Therefore, capital punishment is morally permissible  Now, apply any method of assessing validity to this argument and you will see that it is valid by any method. If we use the informal test (by trying to imagine that the premises are true while the conclusion is false), then the argument passes the test, since any time the premise is true, the conclusion will have to be true as well (since it is the exact same statement). Likewise, the argument is valid by our formal test of validity, truth tables. But while this argument is technically valid, it is still a really bad argument. Why? Because the point of giving an argument in the first place is to provide some reason for thinking the conclusion is true for those who don\u2019t already accept the conclusion.",
