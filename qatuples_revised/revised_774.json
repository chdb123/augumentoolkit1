    "What is the distinction between an assertion that commits to existence and one that doesn't?",
    "An assertion that commits to existence claims that something must exist; one that doesn't makes no claim about existence only asserts a property of things that do exist.",
    "The \u201cS\u201d terms in the above categorical statements are \u201ctrespassers,\u201d \u201cbodies that are not acted on by any force,\u201d and \u201cpassenger cars that can travel 770 mph.\u201d Now ask yourself: do these statements commit us to the existence of either trespassers or bodies not acted on by any force? No, they don\u2019t. Just because we assert the rule that all trespassers will be fined, we do not necessarily commit ourselves to the claim that there are trespassers. Rather, what we are saying is anything that is a trespasser will be fined. But this can be true, even if there are no trespassers! Likewise, when Isaac Newton asserted that all bodies that are not acted on by any force remain at rest, he was not committing himself to the existence of \u201cbodies not acted on by any force.\u201d  Rather, he was saying that anything that is a body not acted on by any force will remain in motion. But this can be true, even if there are no bodies not acted on by any force! (And there aren\u2019t any such bodies, since even things that are stationary like your house or your car parked in the driveway are still acted on by forces such as gravity and friction.Finally, in asserting that all passenger cars that can travel 770 mph are supersonic, we are not committing ourselves to the Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  129 existence of any such car.",
