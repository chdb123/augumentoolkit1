    "How can a term be both descriptive and evaluative, according to the text?",
    "A term can be both descriptive and evaluative when it carries negative or positive evaluation, like \"nosy.\"",
    "1.11 Evaluative language  Yet another rhetorical technique that is commonly encountered in argumentation is the use of evaluative language to influence one\u2019s audience to accept the conclusion one is arguing for. Evaluative language can be contrasted with descriptive language. Whereas descriptive language simply describes a state of affairs, without passing judgment (positive or negativeon that state of affairs, evaluative language is used to pass some sort of judgment, positive or negative, on something. Contrast the following two statements:  Bob is tall. Bob is good. \u201cTall\u201d is a descriptive term since being tall is, in itself, neither a good nor bad thing. Rather, it is a purely descriptive term that does not pass any sort of judgment, positive or negative, on the fact that Bob is tall. In contrast, \u201cgood\u201d is a purely evaluative term, which means that the only thing the word does is make an evaluation (in this case, a positive evaluation) and doesn\u2019t carry any descriptive content. \u201cGood,\u201d \u201cbad,\u201d \u201cright,\u201d and \u201cwrong\u201d are examples of purely evaluative terms. The interesting kinds of terms are those that are both descriptive and evaluative. For example:  Bob is nosy. \u201cNosy\u201d is a negatively evaluative term since to call someone nosy is to make a negative evaluation of them\u2014or at least of that aspect of them.",
