    "What is the main argument presented in President Obama's September 10, 2013 speech on Syria in 'Introduction to Logic and Critical Thinking'?",
    "The main argument in President Obama's speech was that the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian government against its people is a violation of international norms and human decency, and that a limited military response is justified to deter future use. He also argued for congressional approval before taking action.",
    "\u201cGood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d are what philosophers call normative concepts because they involve standards of evaluation.5 Since logic concerns what makes something a good argument, logic is sometimes referred to as a normative science. They key standard of evaluation of arguments that we have seen so far is that of validity. In chapter 2 we will consider some more precise, formal methods of understanding validity. Other \u201cnormative sciences\u201d include ethics (the study of what a good life is and how we ought to liveand epistemology (the study of what we have good reason to believe). 1.12 Analyzing a real-life argument  In this section I will analyze a real-life argument\u2014an excerpt from President Obama\u2019s September 10, 2013 speech on Syria. I will use the concepts and techniques that have been introduced in this chapter to analyze and evaluate Obama\u2019s argument. It is important to realize that regardless of one\u2019s views\u2014 whether one agrees with Obama or not\u2014one can still analyze the structure of the argument and even evaluate it by applying the informal test of validity to the reconstructed argument in standard form. I will present the excerpt of Obama\u2019s speech and then set to work analyzing the argument it contains. In addition to creating the excerpt, the only addition I have made to the speech is numbering each paragraph with Roman numerals for ease of referring to specific places in my analysis of the argument.
