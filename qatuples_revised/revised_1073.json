    "What is a conjunction fallacy in the context of probability theory?",
    "A conjunction fallacy occurs when one assumes that the probability of two events happening together is greater than the sum of their individual probabilities.",
    "However, the probability that she is both a bank teller and active in the feminist movement must be computed as the probability of a conjunction, like this:   .4 \u00d7 .9 = .36  So given these probability assignments (which I\u2019ve just made up but seem fairly plausible), the probability of Linda being both a bank teller and active in the feminist movement is .36. But .36 is a lower probability than .4, which was the probability that she is bank teller. So option b cannot be more probable than option a. Notice that even if we say it is absolutely certain that Linda is active in the feminist movement (i.e., we set the probability of her being active in the feminist movement at 1), option b is still only equal to the probability of option a, since (.4)(1= .4. Sometimes it is easy to avoid committing conjunction fallacies. Here is an example that illustrates that we can in fact easily see that a conjunction is not more probable than either of its conjuncts. Which is more probable? a. Mark has hair b. Mark has blonde hair  In this case, it is clear which of the options is more probable. Clearly a is more probable since it requires less to be true. Option a would be true even if option Chapter 3: Evaluating inductive arguments and probabilistic and statistical fallacies  178 b is true.",
