    "What are the two conditions for an argument from analogy to be strong?",
    "The two conditions for an argument from analogy to be strong are that the characteristics of the two things being compared must be similar in relevant respects to the characteristic cited in the conclusion, and there must not be any relevant disanalogies between the two things being compared.",
    "So we\u2019ve seen that an argument from analogy is strong only if the following two conditions are met:                               2 http://www.givewell.org/giving101/Your-dollar-goes-further-overseas Chapter 3: Evaluating inductive arguments and probabilistic and statistical fallacies  158 1. The characteristics of the two things being compared must be similar in relevant respects to the characteristic cited in the conclusion. 2. There must not be any relevant disanalogies between the two things being compared. Arguments from analogy that meet these two conditions will tend to be stronger inductive arguments. Exercise 24: Evaluate the following arguments from analogy as either strong or weak. If the argument is weak, cite what you think would be a relevant disanalogy. 1. Every painting by Rembrandt contains dark colors and illuminated faces, therefore the original painting that hangs in my high school is probably by Rembrandt, since it contains dark colors and illuminated faces. 2. I was once bitten by a poodle. Therefore, this poodle will probably bite me too. 3. Every poodle I\u2019ve ever met has bitten me (and I\u2019ve met over 300 poodles). Therefore, this poodle will probably bite me too. 4. My friend took Dr. Van Cleave\u2019s logic class last semester and got an A.",
