    "How can the rule p v q be used in a proof?",
    "The rule p v q can be used in a proof by asserting a proposition (pand then using it to justify any other proposition (q), even if we don't know whether q is true or false, since it doesn't matter for the conclusion. This helps simplify proofs when dealing with complex disjunctions.",
    "\u2234 p v q  What this rule says, in words, is that that if we have asserted some proposition, p, then we are entitled to assert the disjunction of that proposition p and any Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  103 other proposition q we wish. Here\u2019s the simple justification of the rule. If we know that p is true, and a disjunction is true if at least one of the disjuncts is true, then we know that the disjunction p v q is true even if we don\u2019t know whether q is true or false. Why? Because it doesn\u2019t matter whether q is true or false, since we already know that p is true. The hardest thing to understand about this rule is why we would ever want to use it. The best answer I can give you for that right now is that it can help us out when doing proofs.3   As before, is it important to realize that any argument that has this same form, is a valid argument. For example,  1. A v B 2. \u2234 (A v Bv (~C v D)  is a valid inference because it has the same form as addition. The first premise asserts a statement (which in this case is complex\u2014a disjunction) and the conclusion is a disjunction of that statement and some other statement. In this case, that other statement is itself complex (a disjunction).",
