Although you cannot construct a proof to show that an argument is invalid, you can construct proofs to show that an argument is valid. The reason proofs are helpful, is that they allow us to show that certain arguments are valid much more efficiently than do truth tables. For example, consider the following argument:  1. (R v S) \u2283 (T \u2283 K) 2. ~K 3.",
