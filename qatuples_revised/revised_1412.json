    "What does it mean for an explanation to be 'conservative'?",
    "A conservative explanation posits only what is necessary and avoids introducing new or unsupported ideas.",
    "Why not just say that it is \u201can animal\u201d rather than \u201can escaped zoo animal.\u201d Unless she has some evidence relevant to the escaped zoo animal hypothesis, she should just leave it at the more general \u201canimal\u201d hypothesis. Furthermore, the explanation may be said to lack power, as well. Since most such noises are made by creatures in the wild, not escaped zoo animals, the \u201ccreatures in the wild\u201d explanation is more powerful, since it is used to explain a much wider range of similar observations (i.e., hearing rustling in the bushes and sticks cracking on the ground while in the woods). 10. Simplicity. The simpler explanation is that Bill was speeding, not that they had tracked his overdue library book. It also lacks power since most of the time when people are pulled over on the highway it is for speeding, not unreturned library books. 11. This is a good explanation and seems to lack no explanatory virtue. 12. This explanation clearly lacks modesty. Why say that someone was going precisely 13.74 mph over the speed limit rather than saying that they were going over the speed limit (without specifying how far)? That specificity is not justified by the observed facts. 13. Conservativeness. We have no good reason for positing some whole new breed of rats\u2014especially if the claim is that they evolved in her apartment only.",
