    "How could you modify the given argument to make it valid without changing its conclusion?",
    "You can change the premise \"no sex-offenders are allowed to work with children\" to \"where Gary lives, no convicted sex-offenders are allowed to work with children,\" making it a weaker statement. This allows for other places where sex-offenders might be allowed to work with children but still makes the argument valid in Gary's location. The new argument would be: 1. Gary is a convicted sex-offender. 2. Where Gary lives, no convicted sex-offenders are allowed to work with children. 3. Therefore, Gary is not allowed to work with children. (from 1-2This argument is now valid.",
    "But what is the argument\u2019s missing premise? The obvious one is that no sex- offenders are allowed to work with children, but we could also use a weaker statement like this one:  Where Gary lives, no convicted sex-offenders are allowed to work with children. It should be obvious why this is a \u201cweaker\u201d statement. It is weaker because it is not so universal in scope, which means that it is easier for the statement to be made true. By relativizing the statement that sex-offenders are not allowed to work with children to the place where Gary lives, we leave open the possibility that other places in the world don\u2019t have this same restriction. So even if there are other places in the world where convicted sex-offenders are allowed to work with children, our statements could still be true since in this place (the place where Gary livesthey aren\u2019t. (For more on strong and weak statements, see section 1.10). So here is the argument in standard form:  1. Gary is a convicted sex-offender. 2. Where Gary lives, no convicted sex-offenders are allowed to work with children. 3. Therefore, Gary is not allowed to work with children. (from 1-2)  This argument is now valid: there is no way for the conclusion to be false, assuming the truth of the premises. This was a fairly simple example where the Chapter 1: Reconstructing and analyzing arguments  27 missing premise needed to make the argument valid was relatively easy to see.",
