    "How does assuring an audience relate to guarding a claim in 'Introduction to Logic and Critical Thinking'?",
    "Assuring weakens the claim by providing further reasons, while guarding weakens it to make it harder to show as false. They are different strategies but can be used together.",
    "There are three common strategies for doing this:  Chapter 1: Reconstructing and analyzing arguments  32 Assuring: informing someone that there are further reasons although one is not giving them now  Guarding: weakening one\u2019s claims so that it is harder to show that the claims are false  Discounting: anticipating objections that might be raised to one\u2019s claim or argument as a way of dismissing those objections.3  We will discuss these in order, starting with assuring. Why would we want to assure our audience? Presumably when we make a claim that isn\u2019t obvious and that the audience may not be inclined to believe. For example, if I am trying to convince you that the United States is one of the leading producers of CO2 emissions, then I might cite certain authorities such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCCas saying so. This is one way of assuring our audience: by citing authorities. There are many ways to cite authorities, some examples of which are these:  Dentists agree that\u2026  Recent studies have shown\u2026  It has been established that\u2026  Another way of assuring is to comment on the strength of one\u2019s own convictions.",
