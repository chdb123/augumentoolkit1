The following exercises will give you some practice with constructing proofs. Exercise 17: Construct proofs for the following valid arguments. The first fifteen proofs can be complete in three or less additional lines. The next five proofs will be a bit longer. It is important to note that there is always more than one way to construct a proof. If your proof differs from the answer key, that doesn\u2019t mean it is wrong. #1 1. A \u22c5 B 2.
