    "How might using different evaluative terms affect public opinion of a politician's actions?",
    "Using positive or negative evaluative terms can change how people perceive and judge a politician's actions, potentially swaying their support or opposition. For instance, calling someone a 'reformer' instead of a 'radical' might make them seem more favorable to the public.",
    "But it also implies a descriptive content, such as that Bob is curious about other people\u2019s affairs. We could re-describe Bob\u2019s nosiness using purely descriptive language:  Bob is very curious about other people\u2019s affairs. Chapter 1: Reconstructing and analyzing arguments  37  Notice that while the phrase \u201cvery curious about other people\u2019s affairs\u201d does capture the descriptive sense of \u201cnosy,\u201d it doesn\u2019t capture the evaluative sense of nosy, since it doesn\u2019t carry with it the negative connotation that \u201cnosy\u201d does. Evaluative language is rife in our society, perhaps especially so in political discourse. This isn\u2019t surprising since by using evaluative language to describe certain persons, actions, or events we can influence how people understand and interpret the world. If you can get a person to think of someone or some state of affairs in terms of a positively or negatively evaluative term, chances are you will be able to influence their evaluation of that person or state of affairs. That is one of the rhetorical uses of evaluative language. Compare, for example,   Bob is a rebel. Bob is a freedom fighter. Whereas \u201crebel\u201d tends to be a negatively evaluative term, \u201cfreedom fighter,\u201d at least for many Americans, tends to be a positively evaluative term. Both words, however, have the same descriptive content, namely, that Bob is someone who has risen in armed resistance to an existing government.",
