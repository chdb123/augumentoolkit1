    "How do antecedents and consequents relate in a conditional statement?",
    "Antecedents are the propositions before the \"if\" and consequents are the propositions after the \"then.\" They describe a relationship between them.",
    "\u2234 S \u22c5 ~D   2.7 Conditionals  So far, we have learned how to translate and construct truth tables for three truth functional connectives. However, there is one more truth functional connective that we have not yet learned: the conditional.2 The English phrase that is most often used to express conditional statements is \u201cif\u2026then.\u201d For example,   If it is raining then the ground it wet. Like conjunctions and disjunctions, conditionals connect two atomic propositions. There are two atomic propositions in the above conditional:   It is raining. 2 Actually, there is one more truth functional connective that we will not be learning and that is what is called the \u201cbiconditional\u201d or \u201cmaterial equivalence.\u201d However, since the biconditional is equivalent to a conjunction of two different conditionals, we don\u2019t actually need it. Although I will discuss material equivalence in section 2.9, we will not be regularly using it. Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  86   The ground it wet. The proposition that follows the \u201cif\u201d is called the antecedent of the conditional and the proposition that follows the \u201cthen\u201d is call the consequent of the conditional. The conditional statement above is not asserting either of these atomic propositions. Rather, it is telling us about the relationship between them.",
