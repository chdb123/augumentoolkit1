    "How does the conjunction operator function in sentence 10?",
    "In sentence 10, the conjunction functions to connect two statements (B v F and ~(P v D), creating a compound statement where both must be true for the whole to be true.",
    "(T \u22c5 ~S\u22c5 L  (The main operator is the second dot\u2014in this case it doesn\u2019t actually matter which dot since the sentence has the same meaning whichever of the conjuncts you treat as the main operator.) 7. E \u22c5 W  (There is only one truth functional operator, the conjunction. So that is by default the main operator!) 8. (T v L) \u22c5 ~S  (The main operator is the conjunction.) 9. (B v F) \u22c5 ~(P v D)  (The main operator is the conjunction.) 10. (A \u22c5 J) \u22c5 E  (The main operator is the second dot\u2014in this case it doesn\u2019t actually matter which dot since the sentence has the same meaning whichever of the conjuncts you treat as the main operator.) 11. (A \u22c5 J) v (C \u22c5 M)  (The wedge is the main operator.) 12. S \u22c5 ~H (The main operator is the conjunction.) Exercise 11 1.  a. P = Coral is a plant; A = Coral is an animal b. ~(P \u22c5 A) Answers to exercises  215 c. Main operator is the negation 2.  a. A = Protozoa are eukaryotes; B = Chimpanzees are eukaryotes; C = Protozoa are animals; D = Chimpanzees are animals b.",
