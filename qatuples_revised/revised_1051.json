    "How does drawing one club affect the probability of drawing another club in succession?",
    "Drawing one club increases the probability of drawing another club, as there are fewer cards left in the deck with each subsequent draw. For example, after the first draw, there would be 12 clubs out of 50 cards remaining; after the second draw, only 10 out of 49, and so on.",
    "Since there are four suits (spades, clubs, diamonds, heartseach with an equal number of cards, the probability of drawing a spade is \u00bc or .25. Likewise the probability of drawing a club is .25. Thus, the probability of drawing either a spade or club is:   .25 + .25 = .50  So you have a 50% chance of drawing either a spade or a club. Sometimes events are not independent. For example, suppose you wanted to know the probability of drawing 5 clubs from the deck (which in poker is called a \u201cflush\u201d). This time you are holding on to the cards after you draw them rather than replacing them back into the deck. The probability of drawing the first club is simply 13/52 (or \u00bc). However, each of the remaining four draws will be affected by the previous draws. If one were to successfully draw all clubs then after the first draw, there would be only 51 cards left, 12 of which were clubs; after the second draw, there would be only 50 cards left, 11 of which were clubs, and so on, like this:   13/52 \u00d7 12/51 \u00d7 11/50 \u00d7 10/49 \u00d7 9/48 = 33/66,640  As you can see, we\u2019ve had to determine the probability of a conjunction, since we want card 1 and card 2 and card 3 etc. to all be clubs.",
