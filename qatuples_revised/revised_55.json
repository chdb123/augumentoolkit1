    "What is the difference between 'because' and 'so' as conclusion indicators?",
    "'Because' introduces a reason or cause for a statement, while 'so' indicates a consequence. In logic, 'so' can be used to connect premises that lead to a conclusion.",
    "However, we cannot substitute \u201cbecause\u201d for \u201cso\u201d in the so-happy-I-finished- that-class example:  I am because happy to have finally finished that class. Chapter 1: Reconstructing and analyzing arguments  7 Obviously, in the latter case the substitution of one conclusion indicator for another makes the sentence meaningless, which means that the \u201cso\u201d that occurred originally wasn\u2019t functioning as a conclusion indicator. Exercise 2: Which of the following are arguments? If it is an argument, identify the conclusion of the argument. 1. The woman in the hat is not a witch since witches have long noses and she doesn\u2019t have a long nose. 2. I have been wrangling cattle since before you were old enough to tie your own shoes. 3. Albert is angry with me so he probably won\u2019t be willing to help me wash the dishes. 4. First I washed the dishes and then I dried them. 5. If the road wasn\u2019t icy, the car wouldn\u2019t have slid off the turn. 6. Albert isn\u2019t a fireman and he isn\u2019t a fisherman either. 7. Are you seeing that rhinoceros over there? It is huge! 8. The fact that obesity has become a problem in the U.S. is shown by the fact that obesity rates have risen significantly over the past four decades. 9.",
