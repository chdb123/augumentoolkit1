    "What type of fallacy would it be to claim that county X has both high and low kidney cancer rates?",
    "It would be a contradiction fallacy.",
    "It is easy to see why once we consider the counties that have the highest incidence of kidney cancer: they are counties that are mostly rural, sparsely populated, and located in traditionally Republican states! So whatever it was you thought might account for the lower cancer rates in rural counties can\u2019t be the right explanation, since these counties also have the highest rates of cancer. It is important to understand that it isn\u2019t the same counties that have the highest and lowest rates\u2014for example, county X doesn\u2019t have both a high and a low cancer rate (relative to other U.S. counties). That would be a contradiction (and so can\u2019t possibly be true). Rather, what is the case is that counties that have the highest kidney cancer rates are \u201cmostly rural, sparsely populated, and located in traditionally Republican states\u201d but also counties that have the lowest kidney cancer rates are \u201cmostly rural, sparsely populated, and located in traditionally Republican states.\u201d How could this be? Before giving you the explanation, I\u2019ll give you a simpler example and see if you can figure it out from that example. Suppose that a jar contains equal amounts of red and white marbles. Jack and Jill are taking turns drawing marbles from the jar. However, they draw marbles at different rates. Jill draws 10 marbles at a time while Jack draws 3 marbles at a time.",
