    "What is the universal negative form of 'Some birds are taller than President Obama'?",
    "Some birds are not shorter than President Obama.",
    "Here they are (with the name of the type of statement in parentheses to the right:   No S are P   (universal negative  Some S are P  (particular affirmative)   Some S are not P  (particular negative)  Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  119 Here are three examples of statements that have these three forms (respectively):  No reptiles give live birth  Some birds are taller than President Obama  Some birds don\u2019t fly  Notice that although these three statements don\u2019t have exactly the same form as the statement forms above, they can be translated into those same forms. All we have to do is figure out the noun phrase that describes each category that the statement is referring to. Let\u2019s start with \u201cno reptiles give live birth.\u201d This categorical statement refers to two different categories: the category of \u201creptiles\u201d and the category of \u201cthings that give live birth.\u201d Notice, again, that I added \u201cthings that\u2026\u201d to the predicate of the sentence (\u201cgive live birth\u201d) because \u201cgive live birth\u201d is not a description of a category. Rather, the way of describing the category is with the noun phrase, \u201cthings that give live birth.\u201d  Using these two category descriptions, we can translate this sentence to have the same form as its categorical form.",
