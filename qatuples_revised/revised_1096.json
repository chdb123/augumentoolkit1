    "In the given scenario with a 90% accurate machine and a trustworthy source, how many people would be falsely identified as a terrorist?",
    "If there are 30 people in the building, and the machine is 10% likely to produce false positives (due to base rate fallacy), then 3 people would be falsely identified as a terrorist.",
    "And if the number of false positives is high, then this will significantly lower the probability that the identification method has correctly identified the phenomenon in question. From the above example we can see that the general method for determining probabilities when base rates are in play is the following. 1. Determine the number of false positives (i.e., the number of instances that are incorrectly identified by the method2. Determine the number of true positives (i.e., the number of instances that are correctly determined by the method) 3. Use the following equation to figure probability:  ! \"#$ &'()! )*$( ! \"#$ &'()! )*$( + ,-. ($ &'()! )*$(  Before closing this section, let\u2019s look at a couple more examples of a base rate fallacy. Suppose that the government has developed a machine that is able to detect terrorist intent with an accuracy of 90%. During a joint meeting of congress, a highly trustworthy source says that there is a terrorist in the building. (Let\u2019s suppose, for the sake of simplifying this example, that there is in fact a terrorist in the building.) In order to determine who the terrorist is, the building Chapter 3: Evaluating inductive arguments and probabilistic and statistical fallacies  181 security seals all the exits, rounds up all 3000 people in the building and uses the machine to test each person.",
