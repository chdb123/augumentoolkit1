    "What does the word 'disjunction' mean?",
    "Disjunction refers to a logical operation that asserts one of two or more alternatives must be true.",
    "The English word that most commonly functions as disjunction is the word \u201cor.\u201d  It is also common that the \u201cor\u201d is preceded by an \u201ceither\u201d earlier in the sentence, like this:   Either Charlie or Violet tracked mud through the house. What this sentence asserts is that one or the other (and possibly bothof these individuals tracked mud through the house. Thus, it is composed out of the following two atomic propositions:  Charlie tracked mud through the house  Violet tracked mud through the house  If the fact is that Charlie tracked mud through the house, the statement is true. If the fact is that Violet tracked mud through the house, the statement is also true. This statement is only false if in fact neither Charlie nor Violet tracked mud through the house. This statement would also be true even if it was both Charlie and Violet who tracked mud through the house. Another example of a disjunction that has this same pattern can be seen in the \u201cclick it or ticket\u201d campaign of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Think about what the slogan means. What the campaign slogan is saying is:   Either buckle your seatbelt or get a ticket  This is a kind of warning: buckle your seatbelt or you\u2019ll get a ticket. Think about the conditions under which this statement would be true.",
