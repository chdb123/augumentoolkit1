    "How does negation relate to the atomic proposition D, and what is its symbolic representation in 'Introduction to Logic and Critical Thinking' by Matthew Van Cleave?",
    "Negation relates to D by asserting that Noelle will not do the dishes, which is represented as ~D.",
    "It contains three atomic propositions which are:   Noelle will feed the dogs (F Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  67  Noelle will clean her room (C)   Noelle will do the dishes (D)  What I\u2019ve written in parentheses to the right of the statement is the constant that I\u2019ll use to represent these atomic statements in my symbolic translation. Notice that the sentence is definitely not asserting that each of these statements is true. Rather, what we have to do is use these atomic propositions to capture the meaning of the original English sentence using only our truth-functional operators. In this sentence we will actually use all three truth-functional operators (disjunction, conjunction, negation). Let\u2019s start with negation, as that one is relatively easy. Given how we have represented the atomic proposition, D, to say that Noelle will not do the dishes is simply the negation of D:   ~D  Now consider the first part of the sentence: Noelle will either feed the dogs or clean her room. You should see the \u201ceither\u2026or\u201d there and recognize it as a disjunction, which we represent with the wedge, like this:   F v C  Now, how are these two compound propositions, \u201c~D\u201d and \u201cF v C\u201d themselves connected?",
