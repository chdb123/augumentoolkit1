    "How does the conclusion follow from the premises in the valid argument?",
    "The conclusion follows because if either M or ~N implies H (disjunction), and we know that M is true (premise 1), then H must be true. And since H implies N (consequent of premise 3), it means N is also true (modus ponens).",
    "That this argument is valid should be obvious (can you imagine a scenario where all the premises are true and yet the conclusion is false?). What might not be as obvious is the form that this argument has. However, you should be able to identify that form if you utilize the tools that you have learned so far. The first premise is a disjunction. The second premise is a conditional statement whose antecedent is the left disjunct of the disjunction in the first premise. And the third premise is a conditional statement whose antecedent is the right disjunct of the disjunction in the first premise. The conclusion is the disjunction of the consequents of the conditionals in premises 2 and 3. Here is this form of inference using symbols:  1. p v q 2. p \u2283 r 3. q \u2283 s 4. \u2234 r v s  We have now introduced each of the 8 forms of inference. In the next section I will walk you through some basic proofs that utilize these 8 rules. Exercise 16: Fill in the blanks with the valid form of inference that is being used and the lines the inference follows from. Note: the conclusion is written to the right of the last premise, following the \u201c/\u2234\u201c symbols. Example 1:  1. M \u2283 ~N 2. M 3. H \u2283 N  /\u2234 ~H 4.",
