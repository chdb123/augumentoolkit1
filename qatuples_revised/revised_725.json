    "What is an example of a categorical syllogism with two premises containing only one atomic proposition each?",
    "All humans are mortal (All H are Mand Socrates is human (Some S is H). Conclusion: Therefore, Socrates is mortal. This follows the form AAA-1.",
    "The second premise is a statement about the categories of things that are mortal and things that die. Finally, the conclusion is a statement about humans and things that die. Although you may think that this argument as a similar form as a hypothetical syllogism, it is distinct from a hypothetical syllogism because the premises are not composed of two different atomic propositions. Rather, each premise contains only one atomic proposition. In categorical logic, the logical terms (analogous to the truth functional operators of propositional logicare the terms \u201call\u201d and \u201csome.\u201d In contrast with propositional logic, in categorical logic we will use capital letters to stand Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  117 for categories of things in the world, rather than for atomic propositions. Thus, we can represent the statement:   All humans are mortal  as   All H are M  where \u201cH\u201d stands for the category of \u201chumans\u201d and \u201cM\u201d stands for the category, \u201cthings that are mortal.\u201d Notice that the categories are nouns or noun phrases. Thus, instead of saying that the category is \u201cmortal\u201d I said the category is \u201cthings that are mortal.\u201d It is important to recognize the difference between how the capital letters are being used in categorical logic and how they were used in propositional logic.",
