    "What are some other persuasive techniques besides rational argumentation that can lead to belief?",
    "Advertising techniques and emotional appeals are examples of persuasive methods that can be more effective than rational argumentation.",
    "There are many ways that humans can be caused to believe things besides through rational argumentation. In fact, sometimes these other persuasive techniques are much more effective. (Consider advertising techniques in the 1950s, which more often tried to used argument and evidence to convince consumers to buy products, compared to advertising today, which rarely uses argument and evidence.In any case, evaluative language\u2014especially the use of hybrid terms that have both descriptive and evaluative aspects\u2014can lead people to subtly accept a claim without ever arguing for it. As an analogy for how this could work in conversation, consider the concept of what philosophers4 have called \u201cpresupposition.\u201d If is say something like   Even Jane could pass  I have asserted that Jane could pass the course. But I have also presupposed that Jane is not a very good student (or not very smart) by using the word \u201ceven.\u201d If I were to say \u201cnuh-uh,\u201d this would naturally be taken as rejecting the claim that Jane could pass (i.e., I would be saying that she couldn\u2019t pass). And if I were to agree, I would naturally be taken as agreeing that she could pass. But notice that there isn\u2019t any simply yes/no way to disagree with the presupposition that Jane isn\u2019t a smart/good student.",
