    "What is the difference between deductive and inductive reasoning?",
    "Deductive reasoning starts with general premises and reaches a specific conclusion, ensuring logical certainty. Inductive reasoning goes from specific observations to a probable generalization but allows for uncertainty. This text focuses on deductive reasoning, where the conclusion must be true if the premises are.",
    "Thus we know that on the assumption of the truth of the premises, the conclusion must be true. And that means the argument is valid. In this example, however, premises 1, 2, and 3 are not only assumed to be true but are actually true. However, as we have already seen, the validity of an argument does not depend on its premises actually being true. Here is another example of a valid argument to illustrate that point. 1. A person can be President of the United States only if they were born in Kenya 2. Obama is President of the United States  3. Therefore, Obama was born in Kenya (from 1-2 Clearly, the first premise of this argument is false. But if we were to imagine a scenario in which it is true and in which premise 2 is also true, then the conclusion (\u201cObama was born in Kenya\u201d) must be true. And this means that the argument is valid. We cannot imagine a scenario in which the premises of the argument are true and yet the conclusion is false. The important point to recognize here\u2014a point I\u2019ve been trying to reiterate throughout this section\u2014is that the validity of the argument does not depend on whether or not the Chapter 1: Reconstructing and analyzing arguments  22 premises (or conclusion) are actually true. Rather, validity depends only on the logical relationship between the premises and the conclusion.",
