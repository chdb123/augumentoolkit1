    "When is a 'tu quoque' response not considered a fallacy?",
    "A tu quoque response is not fallacious when the criticism applies to any position, not just the one being criticized. For example, if someone accuses another of taking money from special interest groups and it can be shown that all candidates do so.",
    "4.3.3 Tu quoque  \u201cTu quoque\u201d is a Latin phrase that can be translated into English as \u201cyou too\u201d or \u201cyou, also.\u201d The tu quoque fallacy is a way of avoiding answering a criticism by bringing up a criticism of your opponent rather than answer the criticism. For example, suppose that two political candidates, A and B, are discussing their policies and A brings up a criticism of B\u2019s policy. In response, B brings up her own criticism of A\u2019s policy rather than respond to A\u2019s criticism of her policy. B has here committed the tu quoque fallacy. The fallacy is best understood as a way of avoiding having to answer a tough criticism that one may not have a good answer to. This kind of thing happens all the time in political discourse. Chapter 4: Informal fallacies  206 Tu quoque, as I have presented it, is fallacious when the criticism one raises is simply in order to avoid having to answer a difficult objection to one\u2019s argument or view. However, there are circumstances in which a tu quoque kind of response is not fallacious. If the criticism that A brings toward B is a criticism that equally applies not only to A\u2019s position but to any position, then B is right to point this fact out. For example, suppose that A criticizes B for taking money from special interest groups.",
