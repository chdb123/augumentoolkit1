    "How does the weakening of prohibitions on other weapons of mass destruction affect U.S. national security, according to the text?",
    "An increased likelihood of U.S. troops or allies facing chemical weapons on the battlefield and Iran becoming emboldened to develop a nuclear program are threats to U.S. national security.",
    "If we don\u2019t respond to Assad\u2019s use of chemical weapons and if fighting spills beyond Syrian borders, our allies could face these chemical weapons. 7. If Assad\u2019s regime uses chemical weapons with impunity, it will weaken prohibitions on other weapons of mass destruction. 8. If prohibitions on other weapons of mass destruction are weakened, this will embolden Assad\u2019s ally, Iran, to develop a nuclear program. 9. Therefore, if we don\u2019t respond to Assad\u2019s use of chemical weapons, this will embolden Assad\u2019s ally, Iran, to develop a nuclear program. (from 1, 7-810. An increased likelihood of U.S. troops or allies facing chemical weapons on the battlefield or Iran becoming emboldened to develop a nuclear program are threats to U.S. national security interests. 11. Therefore, a failure to respond to Assad\u2019s use of chemical weapons is a threat to our national security. (from 5, 6, 9, 10)  As always, in this standard form argument I\u2019ve listed in parentheses after the relevant statements which statements those statements follow from. The only thing now missing is how we get from this intermediate conclusion to what I earlier called the main conclusion. The main conclusion (i.e., that it is in national security interests to respond to Assad with military force) might be thought to follow directly. But it doesn\u2019t. It seems that Obama is relying on yet another unstated assumption.",
