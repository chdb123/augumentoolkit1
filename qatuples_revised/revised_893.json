    "What is the principle of simplicity in logic called?",
    "The principle of simplicity is called Ockham's razor, after William of Ockham.",
    "Simplicity: Explanations that posit fewer entities or processes are preferable to explanations that posit more entities or processes. All other things being equal, the simplest explanation is the best. This is sometimes referred to as \u201cOckham\u2019s razor\u201d after William of Ockham (1287-1347), the medieval philosopher and logician. 7. Conservativeness: Explanations that force us to give up fewer well- established beliefs are better than explanations that force us to give up more well-established beliefs. Suppose that when confronted with the observed facts of my car window being broken and my iPod missing, my colleague Jeff hypothesizes that my colleague, Paul Jurczak did it. However, given that I am friends with Paul, that Paul could easily buy an iPod if he wanted one, and that I know Paul to be the kind of person who has probably never stolen anything in his life (much less broken a car window), this explanation would raise many more questions than it answers. Why would Paul want to steal my iPod? Why would he break my car window to do so? Etc. This explanation raises as many questions as it answers and thus it lacks the explanatory virtue of \u201cdepth.\u201d  Chapter 3: Evaluating inductive arguments and probabilistic and statistical fallacies  150  Consider now an explanation that lacks the explanatory virtue of \u201cpower.\u201d A good example would be the stray baseball scenario which is supposed to explain, specifically, the breaking of the car window.",
