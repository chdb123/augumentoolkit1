    "What was the main conclusion of the argument involving Mt. Vesuvius' eruption and its survivability?",
    "The main conclusion was that no one living in Pompeii could have survived the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius.",
    "What most directly supports A is:  B. No one living in Pompeii could have survived the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius. However, there is also a reason offered in support of B. That reason is that:  C. The lava from Mt. Vesuvius was flowing too fast and there was nowhere for someone living in Pompeii to go in order to escape it in time. So the main conclusion (Ais directly supported by B, and B is supported by C.  Since B acts as a premise for the main conclusion but is also itself the conclusion of further premises, we refer to B as an intermediate conclusion. The important thing to recognize here is that one and the same statement can act as both a premise and a conclusion. Statement B is a premise that supports the main conclusion (A), but it is also itself a conclusion that follows from C. Here is how we would put this complex argument into standard form (using numbers this time, as we always do when putting an argument into standard form):  1. The lava from Mt. Vesuvius was flowing too fast and there was nowhere for someone living in Pompeii to go in order to escape it in time. 2. Therefore, no one living in Pompeii could have survived the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius. (from 1) Chapter 1: Reconstructing and analyzing arguments  12 3. Therefore, this account of the eruption of Mt.",
