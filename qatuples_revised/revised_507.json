    "What is a disjunction in logic and how does it function?",
    "A disjunction is an \"or\" operator that connects two propositions, creating a compound proposition where either one or both can be true for the whole to be true. It functions by being true when at least one of its components is true.",
    "Note that our first premise is a more complex sentence that consists of two Number of atomic propositions Number of rows in the truth table 1 2 2 4 3 8 4 16 5 32 Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  83 disjunctions. The main operator is the second disjunction since the two main grouping, denoted by the parentheses, are \u201cA v B\u201d and \u201cC\u201d. Notice, however, that we cannot figure out the truth values of the main operator of the sentence until we figure out the truth values of the left disjunct, \u201cA v B.\u201d So that is where we need to start. Thus, in the truth table below, I have filled out the truth values directly underneath the \u201cA v B\u201d part of the sentence by using the truth values I have assigned to A and B in the reference columns. As you can see in the truth table below, each line is true except for the last two lines, which are false, since a disjunction is only false when both of the disjuncts are false. (If you need to review the truth table for disjunction, please see section 2.3.)",
