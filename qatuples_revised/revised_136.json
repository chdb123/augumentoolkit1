    "Is the following argument valid or invalid? Joan jumped out of an airplane traveling 30 mph at a height of 10,000 ft without a parachute. She fell to her death.",
    "The argument is invalid because there are scenarios where someone could survive under these conditions (e.g., being caught by another jumper or landing in a net).",
    "Thus, since it is possible to imagine a scenario in which the premise is true and yet the conclusion is false, the argument is invalid. Let\u2019s slightly change the argument, this time making it clear that the plane is flying:  1. Joan jumped out of an airplane traveling 300 mph at a height of 10,000 ft without a parachute 2. Joan fell to her death (from 1 Is this argument valid? You might think so since you might think that anyone who did such a thing would surely die. But is it possible to not die in the scenario described by the premise? If you think about it, you\u2019ll realize that there are lots of ways someone could survive. For example, maybe someone else who was wearing a parachute jumped out of the plane after them, caught them and attached the parachute-less person to them, and then pulled the ripcord and they both landed on the ground safe and sound. Or maybe Joan was performing a stunt and landed in a giant net that had been set up for that purpose. Or maybe she was just one of those people who, although they did fall to the ground, happened to survive (it has happened before). All of these scenarios are consistent with the information in the first premise being true and also consistent with the conclusion being false. Thus, again, any of these counterexamples show that this argument is invalid. Notice that it is also possible that the scenario described in the premises ends with Joan falling to her death.",
