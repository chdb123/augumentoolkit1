    "Using the truth table in exercise 12, determine if argument 8 is valid or invalid.",
    "Argument 8 is invalid. If A v B is false (A and ~B are both true), then C v ~A must be true (from row 3). But since A is also true, this implies B is false, making the conclusion (C v Afalse as well. So the argument is invalid.",
    "Thus, the explanation of why this argument is invalid is that the sixth row of the table shows a scenario in which the premises are both true and yet the conclusion is false.
