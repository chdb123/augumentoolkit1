    "What does it mean to assess an argument on its own merits?",
    "Assessing an argument on its own merits means evaluating the logic and evidence within the argument without considering the arguer's personal life or character.",
    "So although it may seem that a lawyer is committing an ad hominem fallacy in bringing up things about the witness\u2019s past, these things are actually relevant to establishing the witness\u2019s credibility. In contrast, when considering an argument that has been given, we don\u2019t have to establish the arguer\u2019s credibility because we can assess the argument they have given on its own merits. The arguer\u2019s personal life is irrelevant. 4.3.2 Straw man  Suppose that my opponent has argued for a position, call it position A, and in response to his argument, I give a rationally compelling argument against position B, which is related to position A, but is much less plausible (and thus much easier to refute). What I have just done is attacked a straw man\u2014a position that \u201clooks like\u201d the target position, but is actually not that position. When one attacks a straw man, one commits the straw man fallacy. The straw man fallacy misrepresents one\u2019s opponent\u2019s argument and is thus a kind of irrelevance. Here is an example. Chapter 4: Informal fallacies  204 Two candidates for political office in Colorado, Tom and Fred, are having an exchange in a debate in which Tom has laid out his plan for putting more money into health care and education and Fred has laid out his plan which includes earmarking more state money for building more prisons which will create more jobs and, thus, strengthen Colorado\u2019s economy.",
