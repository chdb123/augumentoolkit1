    "How does using 'argue' and 'argument' equivally weaken the argument about taking a logic class?",
    "It confuses the meaning of arguments, making the conclusion unrelated to the premises. The premise states that taking a logic class helps you learn how to argue, but the conclusion claims there should be fewer arguments.",
    "The problem is that the word \u201cheadache\u201d is used equivocally\u2014that is, in two different senses. In the first premise, \u201cheadache\u201d is used figuratively, whereas in the second premise \u201cheadache\u201d is used literally. The argument is only successful if the meaning of \u201cheadache\u201d is the same in both premises. But it isn\u2019t and this is what makes this argument an instance of the fallacy of equivocation. Here\u2019s another example:  Taking a logic class helps you learn how to argue. But there is already too much hostility in the world today, and the fewer arguments the better. Therefore, you shouldn\u2019t take a logic class. In this example, the word \u201cargue\u201d and \u201cargument\u201d are used equivocally. Hopefully, at this point in the text, you recognize the difference. (If not, go back and reread section 1.1.The fallacy of equivocation is not always so easy to spot. Here is a trickier example:  The existence of laws depends on the existence of intelligent beings like humans who create the laws. However, some laws existed before there were any humans (e.g., laws of physics). Therefore, there must be some non-human, intelligent being that created these laws of nature. Chapter 4: Informal fallacies  196  The term \u201claw\u201d is used equivocally here.",
