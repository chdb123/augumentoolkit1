    "What is the difference between conjunction and disjunction in logic?",
    "Conjunction joins two sentences with a \"and\" (e.g., \"T v L \u22c5 R \u22c5 S\"), while disjunction separates them with an \"or\" (e.g., T v L or R).",
    "There is only one rule that allows us to derive (infera sentence that is a conjunction. That rule is called \u201cconjunction.\u201d The form of the rule conjunction says that in order to derive a conjunction, we need to have each conjunct on a separate line. So, what are the two conjuncts that we would need in order to derive the conjunction that is the conclusion (i.e., \u201c(T v L) \u22c5 (R \u22c5 S)\u201d). We would need both \u201cT v L\u201d on a line and \u201cR \u22c5 S\u201d on a separate line. But look at premise 1\u2014we already have \u201cR \u22c5 S\u201d on its own line! So the only other thing we need to derive is the sentence \u201cT v L\u201d. Once we have that on a separate Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  107 line, then we can use the rule conjunction to conjoin those two sentences to get the conclusion! So the next question we have to ask is: How can I derive the sentence \u201cT v L\u201d? Again, if we are working backwards, the relevant question to ask here is: What rule allows me to derive a disjunction? There are only two: constructive dilemma and addition. However, we know that we won\u2019t be using constructive dilemma since none of the premises are conditional statements, and constructive dilemma requires conditional statements as premises. That leaves addition. Addition allows us to disjoin any statement we like to an existing statement.",
