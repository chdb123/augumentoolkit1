    "Factors like age, location, socioeconomic status, or interests can lead to biased samples if not accounted for.",
    "If morning doves are disproportionately represented during the early morning hours, then his sample will be biased. 3. Even more clearly than the previous example, this one is a biased sample: even if he has an adequate sample size, Tom needs to sample from different times of the day. It is likely that morning doves will be disproportionately represented in the morning, since they are more likely to be out in the morning than other kinds of birds. 4. This example corrects the problems of the previous two: Tom has sampled from different times during the day. As long as he has taken these samples on multiple different days (preferably in different seasons too), then his sample is representative and his generalization is good. 5. Biased sample. Same problem, mutatis mutandis, as #3. 6. This seems to be a good generalization, assuming that he keeps up this regimen on multiple days. The difference, of course, is that instead of making his generalization cover the whole day, his generalization is only about the birds that land in his tree during the night. 7. Biased sample. Of course the home owners will be likely to support a policy that slashes property taxes. Most likely, those on Medicaid (governmental health care support for the elderlywill not be homeowners but will be in nursing home facilities. If the poll had been administered to Medicaid recipients (who are less likely to own homes), the results would likely have been different. 8.",
