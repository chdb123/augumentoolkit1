    "What does 'I can assure you that' imply about one's beliefs?",
    "When someone says, \"I can assure you that,\" they are implying that there must be strong reasons for what they believe and that they trust their own understanding of the situation.",
    "The rhetorical effect is that by commenting on how sure you are that something is true, you imply, without saying, that there must be very strong reasons for what you believe\u2014assuming that the audience believes you are a reasonable person, of course. Here are some ways of commenting on the strength of one\u2019s beliefs:  I\u2019m certain that\u2026  I\u2019m sure that\u2026  I can assure you that\u2026                              3 This characterization and discussion draws heavily on chapter 3, pp. 48-53 of Sinnott- Armstrong and Fogelin\u2019s Understanding Arguments, 9th edition (Cengage Learning). Chapter 1: Reconstructing and analyzing arguments  33  Over the years, I have become convinced that\u2026  I would bet a million dollars that\u2026  Yet another way of assuring one\u2019s audience is to make an audience member feel that it would be stupid, odd, or strange to deny the claim one is making. One common way to do this is by implying that every sensible person would agree with the claim.",
