Invalid 20. Invalid  Exercise 22 1. Hasty generalization (you can\u2019t infer something general from just one case here\u2014the sample size is way too small). There is also a sampling bias present: even if many others people from Silverton, CO drove pickups, it doesn\u2019t follow that people generally do. There is a high percentage of trucks in Silverton because the rough roads there almost require trucks. 2. Biased sample: even if he has an adequate sample size, Tom needs to sample from different times during the morning to be sure that he has a representative sample.",
