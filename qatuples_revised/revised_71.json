    "The main purpose of an argument in logic is to establish that its conclusion is true.",
    "In this case, the premises are supposed to show why we should expect or predict that the conclusion is true. Explanations often give us an understanding of why the conclusion is true. We can think of explanations as a type of argument, we just have to distinguish two different types of argument: those that attempt to establish that their conclusion is true (arguments), and those that attempt to establish why their conclusion is true (explanations). Exercise 3: Which of the following is an explanation and which is an argument? Identify the main conclusion of each argument or explanation. (Remember if the premise(sseems to be establishing that the conclusion is true, it is an argument, but if the premise(s) seems to be establishing why the conclusion is true, it is an explanation.) 1. Wanda rode the bus today because her car was in the shop. 2. Since Wanda doesn\u2019t have enough money in her bank account, she has not yet picked up her car from the shop. 3. Either Bob or Henry rode the bus to work today. But it wasn\u2019t Henry because I saw him riding his bike to work. Therefore, it was Bob. 4. It can\u2019t be snowing right now since it only snows when it is 32 degrees or below and right now it is 40 degrees. Chapter 1: Reconstructing and analyzing arguments  10 5.",
