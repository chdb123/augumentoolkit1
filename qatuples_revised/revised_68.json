    "What is the distinction between an argument and an explanation, according to 'Introduction to Logic and Critical Thinking' by Matthew Van Cleave?",
    "An argument attempts to show that a claim is true, while an explanation assumes the truth of the claim and gives reasons for it.",
    "Since eating foods high in sugar and low in fiber triggers the insulin system to start storing those calories as fat, it follows that people who consume foods high in sugar and low in fiber will tend to store more of the calories consumed as fat. Chapter 1: Reconstructing and analyzing arguments  9 This passage gives an explanation for why obesity is on the rise in the U.S. Unlike the earlier example, here it is taken for granted that obesity is on the rise in the U.S. That is the claim whose truth we are trying to explain. We can put the obesity explanation into standard form just like any other argument. In order to do this, I will make some paraphrases of the premises and conclusion of the argument (for more on how to do this, see section 1.5 below). 1. Over the past four decades, Americans have increasingly consumed foods high in sugar and low in fiber. 2. Consuming foods high in sugar and low in fat triggers the insulin system to start storing those calories as fat. 3. When people store more calories as fat, they tend to become obese. 4. Therefore, the rate of obesity is on the rise in the U.S.  Notice that in this explanation the premises (1-3attempt to give a reason for why the conclusion is true, rather than a reason for thinking that the conclusion is true. That is, in an explanation we assume that what we are trying to explain (i.e., the conclusion) is true.",
