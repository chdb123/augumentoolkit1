    "Can you think of another explanation for a correlation between two things besides causation?",
    "Yes, a third factor could cause both. For example, Bob's drinking too much might cause him to sleep with all his clothes on and wake up with a headache.",
    "In the police/crime case, drawing on our background knowledge we can easily come up with an inference to the best explanation argument for why increased police presence on the streets would lower the crime rate\u2014the more police on the street, the harder it is for criminals to get away with crimes because there are fewer places where those crimes could take place without the criminal being caught. Since criminals don\u2019t want to risk getting caught when they commit a crime, seeing more police around will make them less likely to commit a crime. In contrast, there is no good explanation for why decreased crime would cause there to be more police on the street. In fact, it would seem to be just the opposite: if the crime rate is low, the city should cut back, or at least remain stable, on the number of police officers and put those resources somewhere else. This makes it plausible to infer that it is the increased police officers on the street that is causing the decrease in crime. Sometimes two things can be correlated without either one causing the other. Rather, some third thing is causing them both. For example, suppose that Bob discovers a correlation between waking up with all his clothes on and waking up Chapter 3: Evaluating inductive arguments and probabilistic and statistical fallacies  166 with a headache. Bob might try to infer that sleeping with all his clothes on causes headaches, but there is probably a better explanation than that. It is more likely that Bob\u2019s drinking too much the night before caused him to pass out in his bed with all his clothes on, as well as his headache.",
