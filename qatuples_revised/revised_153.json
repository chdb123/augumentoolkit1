    "How does validity differ from soundness in a deductive argument?",
    "Validity refers to whether the conclusion follows from the premises, while soundness refers to whether the premises are true. A valid argument can be unsound if its premises are false, and vice versa.",
    "But none of these activities have anything to do with logic, per se. The relevant disciplines to consult if you want to know whether a particular statement is true is almost never logic! For example, logic has nothing to say regarding whether or not protozoa are animals or whether there are predators that aren\u2019t in the animal kingdom. In order to learn whether those statements are true, we\u2019d have to consult biology, not logic. Since this is a logic textbook, however, it is best to leave the question of what is empirically true or false to the relevant disciplines that study those topics. And that is why the issue of soundness, while crucial for any good argument, is outside the purview of logic. 1.8 Deductive vs. Inductive arguments  The concepts of validity and soundness that we have introduced apply only to the class of what are called \u201cdeductive arguments\u201d. A deductive argument is an argument whose conclusion is supposed to follow from its premises with absolute certainty, thus leaving no possibility that the conclusion doesn\u2019t follow from the premises. For a deductive argument to fail to do this is for it to fail as a deductive argument. In contrast, an inductive argument is an argument whose conclusion is supposed to follow from its premises with a high level of probability, which means that although it is possible that the conclusion doesn\u2019t follow from its premises, it is unlikely that this is the case.",
