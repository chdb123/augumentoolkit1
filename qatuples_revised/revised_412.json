    "How many atomic propositions are in 'Noelle will either feed the dogs or clean her room, but she will not do the dishes'?",
    "This sentence contains two atomic propositions: Noelle will feed the dogs and Noelle will clean her room. The negation is not an atomic proposition because it applies to both.",
    "Parentheses are using in formal logic to show groupings. In this case, the parentheses represent that the conjunction, \u201cC \u22c5 G,\u201d is grouped together and the negation ranges over that whole conjunction rather than just the first conjuct (as was the case with the previous translation). When using multiple operators, you must learn to distinguish which operator is the main operator. The main operator of a sentence is the one that ranges over (influencesthe whole sentence. In this case, the main operator is the negation, since it influences the truth value of all the rest of the sentence. In contrast, in the previous example (~C \u22c5 G), the main operator was the conjunction rather than the negation since it influences both parts of sentence (i.e., both the \u201c~C\u201d and the \u201cG\u201d). We can see the need for parentheses in distinguishing these two different translations. Without the use of parentheses, we would have no way to distinguish these two sentences, which clearly have different meanings. Here is a different example where we must utilize parentheses:  Noelle will either feed the dogs or clean her room, but she will not do the dishes. Can you tell how many atomic propositions this sentence contains?",
