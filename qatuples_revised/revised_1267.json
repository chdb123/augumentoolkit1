    "What is a tuoque fallacy?",
    "A tuoque fallacy occurs when someone accuses their opponent of doing something they themselves are also guilty of, attempting to deflect criticism.",
    "In this case, B would be totally right (and there would be no tu quoque fallacy committedto respond that not only does A take money from special interest groups, but every political candidate running for office does. That is just a fact of life in American politics today. So A really has no criticism at all to B since everyone does what B is doing and it is in many ways unavoidable. Thus, B could (and should) respond with a \u201cyou too\u201d rebuttal and in this case that rebuttal is not a tu quoque fallacy. 4.3.4 Genetic fallacy  The genetic fallacy occurs when one argues (or, more commonly, implies) that the origin of something (e.g., a theory, idea, policy, etc.) is a reason for rejecting (or accepting) it. For example, suppose that Jack is arguing that we should allow physician assisted suicide and Jill responds that that idea first was used in Nazi Germany. Jill has just committed a genetic fallacy because she is implying that because the idea is associated with Nazi Germany, there must be something wrong with the idea itself. What she should have done instead is explain what, exactly, is wrong with the idea rather than simply assuming that there must be something wrong with it since it has a negative origin. The origin of an idea has nothing inherently to do with its truth or plausibility. Suppose that Hitler constructed a mathematical proof in his early adulthood (he didn\u2019t, but just suppose).",
