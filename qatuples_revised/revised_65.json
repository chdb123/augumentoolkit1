    "What is the difference between the simple argument and the explanation for the rise in obesity rates?",
    "The simple argument states that obesity is rising because multiple studies by CDC and NIH show it, while the explanation provides a reason for why obesity is rising (increased sugar and decreased fiber in foods).",
    "I may cite evidence such as studies from the Center for Disease Control (CDCand the National Institute of Health (NIH). The studies I cite would function as premises for the conclusion that obesity rates are rising. For example:  We know that obesity is on the rise in the U.S. because multiple studies carried out by the CDC and NIH have consistently shown a rise in obesity over the last four decades. We could put this simple argument into standard form like this:  1. Multiple studies by the CDC and NIH have consistently shown a rise in obesity over the last four decades. 2. Therefore, obesity is on the rise in the U.S. The standard form argument clearly distinguishes the premise from the conclusion and shows how the conclusion is supposed to be supported by the evidence offered in the premise. Again, the goal of this simple argument would be to convince someone that the conclusion is true. However, sometimes we already know that a statement or claim is true and we are trying to establish why it is true rather than that it is true. An argument that attempts to show why its conclusion is true is an explanation. Contrast the previous example with the following:  The reason that the rate of obesity is on the rise in the U.S. is that the foods we most often consume over the past four decades have increasingly contained high levels of sugar and low levels of dietary fiber.",
