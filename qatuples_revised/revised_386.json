    "In the 'click it or ticket' statement, what are some reasons you might still get a ticket even if your seatbelt is buckled?",
    "You can get a ticket for speeding or driving under the influence of alcohol while wearing your seatbelt. These scenarios show that the disjunction allows both disjuncts to be true, so being buckled does not guarantee no ticket.",
    "There are only four different scenarios:     Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  62 The first and second scenarios (rows 1 and 2are pretty straightforwardly true, according to the \u201cclick it or ticket\u201d statement. But suppose that your seatbelt is buckled, is it still possible to get a ticket (as in the third scenario\u2014row 3)? Of course it is! That is, the statement allows that it could both be true that your seatbelt is buckled and true that you get a ticket. How so? (Think about it for a second and you\u2019ll probably realize the answer.) Suppose that your seatbelt is buckled but your are speeding, or your tail light is out, or you are driving under the influence of alcohol. In any of those cases, you would get a ticket even if you were wearing your seatbelt. So the disjunction, click it or ticket, clearly allows the statement to be true even when both of the disjuncts (the statements that form the disjunction) are true. The only way the disjunction would be shown to be false is if (when pulled over) you were not wearing your seatbelt and yet did not get a ticket. Thus, the only way for the disjunction to be false is when both of the disjuncts are false. These examples reveal a pattern: a disjunction is a truth-functional statement that is true in every instance except where both of the disjuncts are false.",
