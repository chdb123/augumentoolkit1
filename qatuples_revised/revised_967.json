    "In the case of striking a match, it's not just the act itself but also the presence of oxygen that determines whether it causes a flame.",
    "You and I are both human beings, so the color you experience when you see something green probably has the exact same quality. (That is, what you and I experience when we see something green is the exact same experiential color.3.4 Causal reasoning  When I strike a match, it will produce a flame. It is natural to take the striking of the match as the cause that produces the effect of a flame. But what if the matchbook is wet? Or what if I happen to be in a vacuum in which there is no oxygen (such as in outer space)? If either of those things is the case, then the striking of the match will not produce a flame. So it isn\u2019t simply the striking of the match that produces the flame, but a combination of the striking of the match together with a number of other conditions that must be in place in order for the striking of the match to create a flame. Which of those conditions we call the \u201ccause\u201d depends in part on the context. Suppose that I\u2019m in outer space Chapter 3: Evaluating inductive arguments and probabilistic and statistical fallacies  160 striking a match (suppose I\u2019m wearing a space suit that supplies me with oxygen but that I\u2019m striking the match in space, where there is no oxygen). I continuously strike it but no flame appears (of course). But then someone (also in a space suit) brings out a can of compressed oxygen that they spray on the match while I strike it.",
