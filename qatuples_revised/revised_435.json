    "How does the word 'or' function in connecting atomic propositions?",
    "The word 'or' functions as a disjunction, grouping two or more atomic propositions together and indicating that at least one of them must be true.",
    "Thus, the first part of the translation should be:   (~W \u22c5 ~P It is also clear that the last part of the sentence (following the semicolon) is a grouping of V and C and that those two propositions are connected by a disjunction (because of the word \u201cor\u201d):   (V v C)  Finally, these two grouping are connected by a conjunction (because of the \u201chowever,\u201d which is a word the often functions as a conjunction). Thus, the correct translation of the sentence is:   (~W \u22c5 ~P) \u22c5 (V v C)  As we have seen in this section, translating sentences from English into our symbolic language is a process that can be captured as a series of steps:  Step 1: Determine what the atomic propositions are. Step 2: Pick a unique constant to stand for each atomic proposition. Step 3: If the sentence contains more than two atomic propositions, determine which atomic propositions are grouped together and which truth-functional operator connects them. Step 4: Determine what the main operator of the sentence is (i.e., which truth functional operator connects the groups of atomic statements together). Step 5: Once your translation is complete, read it back and see if it accurately captures what the original English sentence conveys.",
