    "What is one rhetorical device mentioned in the last two sections of 'Introduction to Logic and Critical Thinking' by Matthew Van Cleave?",
    "Repetition.",
    "If I tell you over and over again (in creative and subliminal waysto drink Beer x because Beer x is the best beer, then I may very well make you think that Beer x is the best beer, but I have not thereby given you a reason to accept that Beer x is the best beer. Thinking of it rationally, the mere fact that I\u2019ve told you lots of times that Beer x is the best beer gives you no good reason for believing that Beer x is in fact the best beer. The rhetorical devices surveyed in the last two sections may be effective ways of persuading people, but they are not the same thing as offering an argument. Chapter 1: Reconstructing and analyzing arguments  40 And if we attempt to see them as arguments, they turn out to be pretty poor arguments. One of the many things that psychologists study is how we are persuaded to believe or do things. As an empirical science, psychology attempts to describe and explain the way things are, in this case, the processes that lead us to believe or act as we do. Logic, in contrast, is not an empirical science. Logic is not trying to tell us how we do think, but what good thinking is and, thus, how we ought think. The study of logic is the study of the nature of arguments and, importantly, of what distinguishes a good argument from a bad one.",
