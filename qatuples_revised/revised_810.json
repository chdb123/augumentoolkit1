    "What is a universal statement and what is a particular statement?",
    "A universal statement makes a claim about all members of a category, while a particular statement makes a claim about some members of a category.",
    "The strategy is that we should always map universal statements before mapping particular statements. Here is a categorical syllogism that illustrates this point. This time I am going to switch to just using the capital letters S, P, and M to represent the categories. Recall that we can do this because the Venn test of validity is a formal evaluation method where we don\u2019t have to actually understand what the categories represent in the world in order to determine whether the argument is valid. 1. Some S are M 2. All M are P 3.",
