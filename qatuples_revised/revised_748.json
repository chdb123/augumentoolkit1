    "How does the categorical form of 'all S are P' differ from 'some S are P'?",
    "The categorical form 'all S are P' states that every member of category S has property P, while 'some S are P' states that at least one member of category S has property P.",
    "The first step is to ask what two categories are being referred to in this sentence. Here are the two categories: \u201cthings that love me\u201d and \u201cthings that are my mother.\u201d Notice that the category couldn\u2019t just be \u201cmy mother\u201d since that isn\u2019t a category; it\u2019s a particular thing. Again, this sounds strange, but it is important to remember that we are describing categories of things. The next question is: what is this sentence saying is the relationship between these two categories? Hint: it has to be one of the four categorical forms (since any categorical statement can be translated into one of these four forms). The sentence is saying that the only things that love me are things that are my Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  123 mother. The categorical form of the statement is the \u201call S are P\u201d form. Thus, the sentence, translated into the correct categorical form would be:   All things that love me are things that are my mother. We will end this section with one last example. Consider the following categorical statement:   The baboon is a fearsome beast. Which of the four categorical forms does this statement have? Although the article \u201cthe,\u201d which often denotes particulars, may lead one to think that this is a particular affirmative form (some S are P), it is actually a universal affirmative form (all S are P).",
