    "What does 'S' represent in the given propositions from Introduction to Logic and Critical Thinking by Matthew Van Cleave?",
    "In the given propositions, 'S' stands for \"The convict escaped through the sewage pipes.\"",
    "Here are the propositions and the constants that I\u2019ll use to stand for them:   S = The convict escaped through the sewage pipes   D = The convict escaped by hiding out in the back of the delivery van  Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  78 As we can see, the first premise is a disjunction and so, using the constants indicated above, we can translate that first premise as follows:   S v D  The second premise is simply the negation of S:   ~S  Finally, the conclusion is simply the atomic sentence, D. Putting this all together in standard form, we have:  1. S v D 2. ~S  3. \u2234 D  We will use the symbol \u201c\u2234\u201c to denote a conclusion and will read it \u201ctherefore.\u201d  The next thing we have to do is to construct a truth table. We have already seen some examples of truth tables when I defined the truth-functional connectives that I have introduced so far (conjunction, disjunction, and negation). A truth table (as we saw in section 2.2is simply a device we use to represent how the truth value of a complex proposition depends on the truth of the propositions that compose it in every possible scenario. When constructing a truth table, the first thing to ask is how many atomic propositions need to be represented in the truth table.",
