    "What is an inclusive or and exclusive or, and how are they represented symbolically?",
    "An inclusive or (vmeans one or the other must be true; an exclusive or (^) means only one can be true. They are represented as 'F' for \"Bob placed first in the race\" and 'S' for \"Bob placed second in the race\".",
    "This is very different from the following sentence (without parentheses): Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  73   ~p \u22c5 q  The main operator of this statement is the conjunction and the left conjunct of the conjunction is a negation. In contrast with the \u201cnot both\u201d form, this statement asserts that p is not true, while q is true. For example, using our previous example of Carla and the cake, the sentence   ~C \u22c5 I  would assert that Carla will not have cake and will have ice cream. This is a very different statement from ~(C \u22c5 Iwhich, as we have seen, allows the possibility that Carla will have cake but not ice cream. Thus, again we see the importance of parentheses in our symbolic language. Earlier (in section 2.3) we made the distinction between what I called an \u201cexclusive or\u201d and an \u201cinclusive or\u201d and I claimed that although we interpret the wedge (v) as an inclusive or, we can represent the exclusive or symbolically as well. Since we now know how to translate the \u201cnot both,\u201d I can show you how to translate a statement that contains an exclusive or. Recall our example:   Bob placed either first or second in the race. As we saw, this disjunction contains the two disjuncts, \u201cBob placed first in the race\u201d (F) and \u201cBob placed second in the race\u201d (S).",
