    "How do you convert an inclusive or into an exclusive or using dots and wedges?",
    "You use the dot (\u22c5to conjoin the \"not both\" statement ~(F \u22c5 S) with the initial statement F v S, resulting in (F v S) \u22c5 ~(F \u22c5 S).",
    "Using the wedge, we get:   F v S  However, since the wedge is interpreted as an inclusive or, this statement would allow that Bob got both first and second in the race, which is not possible. So we need to be able to say that although Bob placed either first or second, he did not place both first and second. But that is just the \u201cnot both\u201d locution. So, to be absolutely clear, we are asserting two things:   Bob placed either first or second. and   Bob did not place both first and second. Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  74  We have already seen that the first sentence is translated: \u201cF v S.\u201d The second sentence is simply a \u201cnot both F and S\u201d statement:   ~(F \u22c5 S Now all we have to do is conjoin the two sentences using the dot:   (F v S) \u22c5 ~(F \u22c5 S)  That is the correct translation of an exclusive or. Notice that when conjoining the \u201cF v S\u201d to the \u201c~(F \u22c5 S)\u201d I needed to put parentheses around the \u201cF v S\u201d to show that it was grouped together. Thus, it would have been incorrect to write:   F v S \u22c5 ~(F \u22c5 S)  since that is not a well-formed formula.",
