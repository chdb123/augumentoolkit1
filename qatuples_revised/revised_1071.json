    "What other activities might Linda participate in, given that she is concerned with discrimination and social justice?",
    "Linda could participate in various activities like volunteering for non-profits, attending rallies, or working on political campaigns related to discrimination and social justice issues.",
    "As a student, she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice, and also participated in anti-nuclear demonstrations. 6 The following famous example comes from Tversky, A. and Kahneman, D. (1983). Extension versus intuitive reasoning: The conjunction fallacy in probability judgment. Psychological Review, 90(4), 293\u2013315. Chapter 3: Evaluating inductive arguments and probabilistic and statistical fallacies  177 Given this information about Linda, which of the following is more probable? a. Linda is a bank teller. b. Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement. If you are like most people who answer this question, you will answer \u201cb.\u201d But that cannot be correct because it violates the basic rules of probability. In particular, notice that option b contains option a (i.e., Linda is a bank teller). But option b also contains more information\u2014that Linda is also active in the feminist movement. The problem is that a conjunction can never be more probable than either one of its conjuncts. Suppose we say it is very probable that Linda a bank teller (how boring, given the description of Linda which makes her sound interesting!). Let\u2019s set the probability low, say .4. Then what is the probability of her being active in the feminist movement? Let\u2019s set that high, say .9.",
