    "What is the difference between disjunction and exclusive or?",
    "Disjunction includes the possibility of both disjuncts being true, while exclusive or excludes it.",
    "In our symbolic language, the symbol we will use to represent a disjunction is called a \u201cwedge\u201d (v). (You can simply use a lowercase \u201cv\u201d to write the wedge.Here is the truth table for disjunction:          As before, the header of this truth table represents two propositions (first two columns) and their disjunction (last column). The following four rows represent the conditions under which the disjunction is true. As we have seen, the disjunction is true when at least one of its disjuncts is true, including when they are both true (the first three rows). A disjunction is false only if both disjuncts are false (last row).
