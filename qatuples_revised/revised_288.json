    "How does allowing chemical weapons use by Assad relate to the potential danger faced by U.S. troops and allies, according to paragraph 12?",
    "If Assad uses chemical weapons with impunity, then other tyrants will be more likely to attain and use them, which increases the chances of U.S. troops and allies facing these weapons on the battlefield.",
    "(implicit in paragraph 12C. If the ban on chemical weapons erodes, then other tyrants will be more likely to attain and use them. (paragraph 12) D. If other tyrants attain and use chemical weapons, U.S. troops will be more likely to face chemical weapons on the battlefield (paragraph 12) E. If we don\u2019t respond to Assad\u2019s use of chemical weapons and if fighting spills beyond Syrian borders, our allies could face these chemical weapons. (paragraph 13) F. If Assad\u2019s regime uses chemical weapons with impunity, it will weaken prohibitions on other weapons of mass destruction. (paragraph 14) G. If prohibitions on other weapons of mass destruction are weakened, this will embolden Assad\u2019s ally, Iran, to develop a nuclear program. (paragraph 14)  I have tried to make explicit each step of the reasoning, much of which Obama makes explicit himself (e.g., premises A-D). The main threats to national security that failing to respond to Assad would engender, according to Obama, are that U.S. troops and U.S. allies could be put in danger of facing chemical weapons and that Iran would be emboldened to develop a nuclear program. There is a missing premise that is being relied upon for these premises to validly imply the conclusion. Here is a hint as to what that missing premise is: Are all of these things truly a threat to national security?",
