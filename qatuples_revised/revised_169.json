    "What makes an argument valid, according to Matthew Van Cleave?",
    "An argument is valid when its premises guarantee the truth of its conclusion.",
    "Making missing premises explicit is a central part of reconstructing arguments in standard form. We have already dealt in part with this in the section on paraphrasing, but now that we have introduced the concept of validity, we have a useful tool for knowing when to supply missing premises in our reconstruction of an argument. In some cases, the missing premise will be fairly obvious, as in the following:  Gary is a convicted sex-offender, so Gary is not allowed to work with children. Chapter 1: Reconstructing and analyzing arguments  26 The premise and conclusion of this argument are straightforward:  1. Gary is a convicted sex-offender 2. Therefore, Gary is not allowed to work with children (from 1 However, as stated, the argument is invalid. (Before reading on, see if you can provide a counterexample for this argument. That is, come up with an imaginary scenario in which the premise is true and yet the conclusion is false.) Here is just one counterexample (there could be many): Gary is a convicted sex-offender but the country in which he lives does not restrict convicted sex-offenders from working with children. I don\u2019t know whether there are any such countries, although I suspect there are (and it doesn\u2019t matter for the purpose of validity whether there are or aren\u2019t). In any case, it seems clear that this argument is relying upon a premise that isn\u2019t explicitly stated. We can and should state that premise explicitly in our reconstruction of the standard form argument.",
