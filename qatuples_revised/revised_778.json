    "What does it mean for a statement to be supersonic?",
    "Supersonic means traveling faster than the speed of sound.",
    "Rather, we are only saying that were there any such car, it would be supersonic (i.e., it would travel faster than the speed of sound). For various reasons (that we will not discuss here), modern logic treats a universal categorical statement as a kind of conditional statement. Thus, a statement like,   All passenger cars that can travel 770 mph are supersonic  is interpreted as follows:  For any x, if x is a passenger car that can travel 770 mph then x is supersonic. But since conditional statements do not assert either the antecedent or the consequent, the universal statement is not asserting the existence of passenger cars that can travel 770 mph. Rather, it is just saying that if there were passenger cars that could travel that fast, then those things would be supersonic. We will follow modern logic in denying existential commitment. That is, we will not interpret universal affirmative statements of the form \u201cAll S are P\u201d as implying particular affirmative statements of the form \u201csome S are P.\u201d Likewise, we will not interpret universal negative statements of the form \u201cno S are P\u201d as implying particular negative statements of the form \u201csome S are not P.\u201d Thus, when constructing Venn diagrams, you can always rely on the fact that if there is no particular represented in the premise Venn (i.e., there is no asterisk), then if the conclusion Venn represents a particular (i.e., there is an asterisk), the argument will be invalid.",
