    "What is the difference between an argument and persuasion?",
    "An argument itself is independent of one's attempt to convince or persuade, while persuasion is the goal in using an argument.",
    "Therefore, abortion is morally wrong Chapter 1: Reconstructing and analyzing arguments  3  By convention, the last numbered statement (also denoted by the \u201ctherefore\u201dis the conclusion and the earlier numbered statements are the premises. This is what we will call standard argument form. We can now give a more precise definition of an argument. An argument is a set of statements, some of which (the premises) attempt to provide a reason for thinking that some other statement (the conclusion) is true. Although arguments are typically given in order to convince or persuade someone of the conclusion, the argument itself is independent of one\u2019s attempt to use it to convince or persuade. For example, I have just given you this argument not in an attempt to convince you that abortion is morally wrong, but as an illustration of what an argument is. Later on in this chapter and in this book we will learn some techniques of evaluating arguments, but for now the goal is to learn to identify an argument, including its premises and conclusion(s). It is important to be able to identify arguments and understand their structure, whether or not you agree with conclusion of the argument. In the next section I will provide some techniques for being able to identify arguments. Exercise 1: Which of the following sentences are statements and which are not? 1. No one understands me but you. 2. Alligators are on average larger than crocodiles. 3. Is an alligator a reptile or a mammal? 4.",
