    "Why do people tend to think badly of those with whom they don't interact often?",
    "People are prone to \"demonize\" the \"other,\" including those who hold a moral or political position different from their own, and it is easy to forget that these individuals are still people just like us in all important respects.",
    "Fran responds: \u201cproponents of sex education try to encourage our children to a sex-with-no-strings-attached mentality, which is harmful to our children and to our society.\u201d  Fran has committed the straw man (or straw womanfallacy by misrepresenting Nancy\u2019s position. Nancy\u2019s position is not that we should encourage children to have sex, but that we should make sure that they are fully informed about sex so that if they do have sex, they go into it at least a little less blindly and are able to make better decisions regarding sex. Chapter 4: Informal fallacies  205  As with other fallacies of relevance, straw man fallacies can be compelling on some level, even though they are irrelevant. It may be that part of the reason we are taken in by straw man fallacies is that humans are prone to \u201cdemonize\u201d the \u201cother\u201d\u2014including those who hold a moral or political position different from our own. It is easy to think bad things about those with whom we do not regularly interact. And it is easy to forget that people who are different than us are still people just like us in all the important respects. Many years ago, atheists were commonly thought of as highly immoral people and stories about the horrible things that atheists did in secret circulated widely. People believed that these strange \u201cothers\u201d were capable of the most horrible savagery.",
