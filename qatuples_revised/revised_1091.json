    "What is a base rate fallacy and how does it affect probability?",
    "A base rate fallacy occurs when one neglects to account for the low probability of an event happening in the first place, leading to overestimated probabilities. It skews the chances of identifying a positive result.",
    "Chapter 3: Evaluating inductive arguments and probabilistic and statistical fallacies  180 So what are the chances that you are true positive rather than a false positive? It is simply the number of true positives (475divided by the total number of positive identifications that the test would make. This latter number includes those the test would misidentify (4975) as well as the number it would accurately identify (475)\u2014thus the total number the test would identify as having colon cancer would be 5450. So the probability that you have it, given the positive test = 475/5450 = .087 or 8.7%. So the probability that you have cancer, given the evidence of the positive test is 8.7%. Thus, contrary to our initial reasoning that there was a 95% chance that you have colon cancer, the chance is only a tenth of that\u2014it is less than 10%! In thinking that the probability that you have cancer is closer to 95% you would be ignoring the extremely low probability of having the disease in the first place (i.e., the low base rate). Neglecting to account for low base rates in determining the probability of some event is the signature of any base rate fallacy. The general lesson here is that the number of false positives will be quite high (even when the identification method is fairly accurate) as long as the base rate of the phenomenon we\u2019re looking for is very low.",
