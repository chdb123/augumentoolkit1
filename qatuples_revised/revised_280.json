    "How does Obama's argument for Assad using chemical weapons support his conclusion about national security in 'Introduction to Logic and Critical Thinking' by Matthew Van Cleave?",
    "By establishing a causal link between Assad's use of chemical weapons and its consequences on national security.",
    "One clear statement of what looks like a main conclusion comes in paragraph 15 where Obama says:  And that is why, after careful deliberation, I determined that it is in the national security interests of the United States to respond to the Assad regime's use of chemical weapons through a targeted military strike. Chapter 1: Reconstructing and analyzing arguments  43  The phrase, \u201cthat is why,\u201d is a conclusion indicator which introduces the main conclusion. Here is my paraphrase of that conclusion:  Main conclusion: It is in the national security interests of the United States to respond to Assad\u2019s use of chemical weapons with military force. Before Obama argues for this main conclusion, however, he gives an argument for the claim that Assad did use chemical weapons on his own civilians. This is what is happening in paragraphs 1-9 of the speech.",
