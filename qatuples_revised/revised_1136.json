    "What is the purpose of a control group in determining the efficacy of snake oil medicine?",
    "The purpose of a control group is to compare the results of those who took the medicine with those who didn't take it or took a placebo, allowing for a fair comparison.",
    "For example, suppose we could get our snake oil salesman to agree to a study in which a group of people who had colds took the medicine (experimental groupand another group of people didn\u2019t take the medicine or took a placebo (control group). In this situation, if we found that the experimental group got better and the control group didn\u2019t, or if the experimental group got better more quickly than the control group, then perhaps we\u2019d have to say that maybe there is something to this snake oil medicine. But without the evidence of a control for comparison, even if lots of people took the snake oil medicine and got better from their colds, it wouldn\u2019t prove anything about the efficacy of the medicine. 3.10 Gambler\u2019s fallacy  The gambler\u2019s fallacy occurs when one thinks that independent, random events can be influenced by each other. For example, suppose I have a fair coin and I have just flipped 4 heads in a row. Erik, on the other hand, has a fair coin that he has flipped 4 times and gotten tails. We are each taking bets that the next coin flipped is heads. Who should you bet flips the head? If you are inclined to say that you should place the bet with Erik since he has been flipping all tails and since the coin is fair, the flips must even out soon, then you have committed the gambler\u2019s fallacy.",
