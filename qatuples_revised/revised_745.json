    "How do you determine which category a statement belongs to, using formal logic?",
    "By asking whether your translation accurately captures the meaning of the original English sentence.",
    "We have to use our trick of turning the predicate into a noun phrase, i.e., \u201cthings that fly.\u201d Given these two category descriptions, we can then translate the sentence to have the categorical form, some S are not P:   Some birds are not things that fly  Again, although the English sounds clunky here, it has the same form as the categorical form, some S are not P, and it allows us to clearly see what the two categories are. Below is the Venn diagram for this statement:   Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  122   By convention, an asterisk on the Venn diagram means that there is at least one thing in that category. By putting the asterisk inside the \u201cbirds\u201d category, but outside the \u201cthings that fly\u201d category, we are representing that at least one thing that is a bird isn\u2019t a thing that flies. This is exactly what our original sentence was saying. Translating categorical statements into their categorical form can by tricky. In fact, it is probably one of the trickier things you\u2019ll do in formal logic. There is no simple way of doing it other than asking yourself whether your translation accurately captures the meaning of the original English sentence. Here is an example of a tricky categorical statement:   Nobody loves me but my mother. This is a categorical statement, but which of the four categorical forms does it have?",
