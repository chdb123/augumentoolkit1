    "What does it mean when a statement has the form p v ~p?",
    "A statement with the form p v ~p means that p is true if and only if p is true, or in other words, it's always true.",
    "That statement is a tautology, and it has a particular form, which can be represented symbolically like this:   p v ~p  In contrast, consider a statement like:   Matt is both 40 years old and not 40 years old. That statement is a contradiction, and it has a particular form, which can be represented symbolically like this:   p \u22c5 ~p  Finally, consider a statement like:   Matt is either 39 years old or 40 years old  That statement is a contingent statement. It doesn\u2019t have to be true (as tautologies door false (as contradictions do). Instead, its truth depends on the way the world is. Suppose that Matt is 39 years old. In that case, the statement is true. But suppose he is 37 years old. In that case, the statement is false (since he is neither 39 or 40). We can use truth tables to determine whether a statement is a tautology, contradiction or contingent statement. In a tautology, the truth table will be such that every row of the truth table under the main operator will be true. In a contradiction, the truth table will be such that every row of the truth table under the main operator will be false. And contingent statements will be such that there is mixture of true and false under the main operator of the statement. The following two truth tables are examples of tautologies and contradictions, respectively.",
