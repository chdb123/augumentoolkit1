    "How do natural laws differ from societal laws, according to the text?",
    "Natural laws cannot be broken and have no punishments attached to them; they are part of the fabric of the universe, while societal laws are enforced by people.",
    "In the first premise it is used to refer to societal laws, such as criminal law; in the second premise it is used to refer to laws of nature. Although we use the term \u201claw\u201d to apply to both cases, they are importantly different. Societal laws, such as the criminal law of a society, are enforced by people and there are punishments for breaking the laws. Natural laws, such as laws of physics, cannot be broken and thus there are no punishments for breaking them. (Does it make sense to scold the electron for not doing what the law says it will do?As with every informal fallacy we have examined in this section, equivocation can only be identified by understanding the meanings of the words involved. In fact, the definition of the fallacy of equivocation refers to this very fact: the same word is being used in two different senses (i.e., with two different meanings). So, unlike formal fallacies, identifying the fallacy of equivocation requires that we draw on our understanding of the meaning of words and of our understanding of the world, generally. 4.2 Slippery slope fallacies  Slippery slope fallacies depend on the concept of vagueness. When a concept or claim is vague, it means that we don\u2019t know precisely what claim is being made, or what the boundaries of the concept are.",
