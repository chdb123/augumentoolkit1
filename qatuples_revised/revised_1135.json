    "How could one compare two groups to determine if their performance is due to regression to the mean or not?",
    "By comparing their performances over time and looking for patterns in their deviations from the mean. If both groups show a similar pattern of highs and lows, it's likely due to regression to the mean. If one group consistently outperforms the other, it's not.",
    "Suppose that a professional golfer has been on a hot streak. She has been winning every tournament she enters by ten strokes\u2014she\u2019s beating the competition like they were middle school golfers. She is just playing so much better than them. Then something happens. The golfer all of a sudden starts playing like average. What explains her fall from greatness? The sports commentators speculate: could it be that she switched her caddy, or that it is warmer now than is was when she was on her streak, or perhaps it was fame that went to her head once she had started winning all those tournaments? Chances are, none of these are the right explanation because no such explanation is needed. Most likely she just regressed to the mean and is now playing like everyone else\u2014still like a pro, just not like a golfer who is out of this world good. Even those who are skilled can get lucky (or unluckyand when they do, we should expect that eventually that luck will end and they will regress to the mean. As these examples illustrate, one commits the regression to the mean fallacy when one tries to give a causal explanation of a phenomenon that is merely statistical or probabilistic in nature. The best way to rule out that something is Chapter 3: Evaluating inductive arguments and probabilistic and statistical fallacies  186 not to be explained as regression to the mean is by doing a study where one compares two groups.",
