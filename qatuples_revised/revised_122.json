    "How does an invalid argument differ from a valid one, as described by the author?",
    "An invalid argument is one where it's possible for the premise to be true and yet the conclusion false.",
    "Why? Because when we assume the truth of the premises (everyone born in France can speak French, Barack Obama was born in Francethe conclusion (Barack Obama can speak French) must be true. Notice that this is so even though none of these statements is actually true. Not everyone born in France can speak French (think about people who were born there but then moved somewhere else where they didn\u2019t speak French and Chapter 1: Reconstructing and analyzing arguments  19 never learned it) and Obama was not born in France, but it is also false that Obama can speak French. So we have a valid argument even though neither the premises nor the conclusion is actually true. That may sound strange, but if you understand the concept of validity, it is not strange at all. Remember: validity describes the relationship between the premises and conclusion, and it means that the premises imply the conclusion, whether or not that conclusion is true. In order to better understand the concept of validity, let\u2019s look at an example of an invalid argument:  1. George was President of the United States 2. Therefore, George was elected President of the United States (from 1)  This argument is invalid because it is possible for the premise to be true and yet the conclusion false. Here is a counterexample to the argument.",
