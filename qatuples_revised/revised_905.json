    "What does 'explanatory virtue' mean in the context of logical reasoning?",
    "Explanatory virtue refers to the quality of an explanation that effectively explains observed facts and provides a reasonable account for what happened. It is about how well an explanation fits with the available evidence.",
    "Suppose, to return to my broken window/missing iPod scenario, that my friend Chris hypothesized that a 24 year old Chinese man with a Tweety Bird tattoo on his left shoulder broke the window of my car and stole the iPod. This explanation would lack the explanatory virtue of \u201cmodesty.\u201d The problem is that the hypothesis is far more specific than it needs to be in order to explain the relevant observed facts. The details in any explanation should be relevant to explaining the observed facts. However, there is no reason to include the details that the thief was 24 years old, Chinese, and had a Tweety Bird tattoo on his left shoulder. How do those details help us to understand why the observed facts occurred? They don\u2019t. It would be just as explanatory to say, simply, that it was a thief rather than to include all those details about the thief, which don\u2019t help us to understand or explain any of the observed facts. The explanatory virtue of \u201csimplicity\u201d tells us that all other things being equal, the simplest explanation is the better explanation. More precisely, an explanation that posits fewer entities or processes in order to explain the observed facts is better than an explanation that posits more entities and processes to explain that same set of observed facts. Here is an example of an explanation that would lack the virtue of simplicity. Suppose that all three of our cars in our driveway were broken into one night and that the next morning the passenger\u2019s side rear windows of each car were broken out.",
