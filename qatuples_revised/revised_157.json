    "How does adding a new premise change the validity of the inductive argument about Tweets flying?",
    "If we add the premise that Tweets is 6 ft tall and can run 30 mph, the conclusion is no longer supported by the premises, as it implies Tweets is an ostrich or emu, which are not birds that can fly.",
    "Here is an example of an inductive argument: Chapter 1: Reconstructing and analyzing arguments  24  Tweets is a healthy, normally functioning bird and since most healthy, normally functioning birds fly, Tweets probably flies. Notice that the conclusion, Tweets probably flies, contains the word \u201cprobably.\u201d  This is a clear indicator that the argument is supposed to be inductive, not deductive. Here is the argument in standard form:  1. Tweets is a healthy, normally functioning bird 2. Most healthy, normally functioning birds fly 3. Therefore, Tweets probably flies  Given the information provided by the premises, the conclusion does seem to be well supported. That is, the premises do give us a strong reason for accepting the conclusion. This is true even though we can imagine a scenario in which the premises are true and yet the conclusion is false. For example, suppose that we added the following premise:  Tweets is 6 ft tall and can run 30 mph. Were we to add that premise, the conclusion would no longer be supported by the premises, since any bird that is 6 ft tall and can run 30 mph, is not a kind of bird that can fly. That information leads us to believe that Tweets is an ostrich or emu, which are not kinds of birds that can fly.",
