    "What is an example of a probability clause used to guard a claim?",
    "An example of a probability clause used to guard a claim is \"it is possible that\" or \"it is arguable that.\"",
    "We can also guard a claim by introducing a probability clause such as, \u201cit is possible that\u2026\u201d and \u201cit is arguable that\u2026\u201d or by reducing our level of commitment to the claim, such as moving from \u201cI know that x\u201d to \u201cI believe that x.\u201d One common use of guarding is in reconstructing arguments with missing premises using the principle of charity (section 1.9). For example, if an argument is that \u201cTom works for Merrill Lynch, so Tom has a college degree,\u201d the most charitable reconstruction of this argument would fill in the missing premise with \u201cmost people who work for Merrill Lynch have college degrees\u201d rather than \u201ceveryone who works for Merrill Lynch has a college degree.\u201d Here we have created a more charitable (plausiblepremise by weakening the claim from \u201call\u201d to \u201cmost,\u201d which as we have seen is a kind of guarding. Finally, we will consider discounting. Discounting involves acknowledging an objection to the claim or argument that one is making, while dismissing that same objection. The rhetorical force of discounting is to make it seem as though the argument has taken account of the objections\u2014especially the ones that might be salient in a person\u2019s mind. The simplest and most common way of discounting is by using the \u201cA but B\u201d locution. Contrast the following two claims:  A. The worker was inefficient, but honest. B. The worker was honest, but inefficient.",
