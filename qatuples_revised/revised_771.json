    "How does the law 'All trespassers will be fined' relate to existential commitment?",
    "The law \"All trespassers will be fined\" is an example of a universal statement that doesn't imply any specific trespasser exists, but rather describes a rule about the relationship between trespassing and fines. This supports modern logic's interpretation of universal statements.",
    "Therefore, some S are P  Is this inference valid or invalid? As it turns out, this is an issue on which there has been much philosophical debate. On the one hand, it seems that many Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  128 times when we make a universal statement, such as \u201call dogs are mammals,\u201d we imply that there are dogs\u2014i.e., that dogs exist. Thus, if we assert that all dogs are mammals, that implies that some dogs are mammals (just as if I say that everyone at the party was drunk, this implies that at least someone at the party was drunk). In general, it may seem that \u201call\u201d implies \u201csome\u201d (since some is encompassed by all). This reasoning would support the idea that the above inference is valid: universal statements imply certain particular statements. Thus, statements of the form \u201call S are P\u201d would imply that statements of the form \u201csome S are P.\u201d This is what is called \u201cexistential commitment.\u201d   In contrast to the reasoning just laid out, modern logicians reject existential commitment; they do not take statements of the form \u201call S are P\u201d to imply that there exists anything in the \u201cS\u201d category. Why would they think this? One way of understanding why universal statements are interpreted in this way in modern logic is by considering laws such as the following:   All trespassers will be fined. All bodies that are not acted on by any force are at rest. All passenger cars that can travel 770 mph are supersonic.",
