    "Why is it important to have complete rules for evaluating arguments?",
    "Without complete rules, there would be valid arguments that cannot be proven as such within the system.",
    "But an argument or inference can have the same form, regardless of whether the components of those sentences are atomic or complex. That is the important lesson that I have been trying to drill in in this section. The final of our 8 valid forms of inference is called \u201cconstructive dilemma\u201d and is the most complicated of them all. It may be most helpful to introduce it using an example. Suppose I reasoned thus:  The killer is either in the attic or the basement. If the killer is in the attic then he is above me. If the killer is in the basement then his is below me. Therefore, the killer is either _________________ or _________________. Can you fill in the blanks with the phrases that would make this argument valid? I\u2019m guessing that you can. It should be pretty obvious. The conclusion of the argument is the following:                               3 A better answer is that we need this rule in order to make this set of rules that I am presenting a sound a complete set of rules. That is, without it there would be arguments that are valid but that we aren\u2019t able to show are valid using this set of rules. In more advanced areas of logic, such as metalogic, logicians attempt to prove things about a particular system of logic, such as proving that the system is sound and complete.
