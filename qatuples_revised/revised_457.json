    "How does Carla's diet status influence whether 'Carla will eat neither cake nor ice cream' is true or false in the context of Introduction to Logic and Critical Thinking by Matthew Van Cleave?",
    "If Carla is on a diet and sticks to it, then the statement is true. Otherwise, it is false.",
    "The problem, as before, is that this sentence is ambiguous between two sentences that have different meanings:   F v (S \u22c5 ~(F \u22c5 S)  (F v S) \u22c5 ~(F \u22c5 S)  While both of these sentences are well-formed, only the latter is the correct translation of the exclusive or. Let\u2019s move on to the English locution \u201cneither\u2026nor\u201d as in:   Carla will eat neither cake nor ice cream. This statement might be true if, for example, Carla was on a diet (and was sticking to her diet). Using the same method I introduced earlier, we can ask under what conditions the statement would be true or false. As before, there are only four possibilities, which I represent symbolically this time:  C I False C ~I False ~C I False Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  75         There is only one circumstance in which this statement is true and that is the one in which it is false that Carla eats cake and false that Carla eats ice cream. That should be obvious from the meaning of the \u201cneither nor\u201d locution.",
