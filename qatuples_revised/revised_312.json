    "What are some ways to represent the structure of an argument?",
    "One way is by using parentheses to show which statements follow from which, as in 1, 2, 3, 4, and another way is through spatial representation as shown in section 1.4.",
    "An increased likelihood of U.S. troops or allies facing chemical weapons on the battlefield or Iran becoming emboldened to develop a nuclear program are threats to U.S. national security interests. 11. Therefore, a failure to respond to Assad\u2019s use of chemical weapons is a threat to our national security. (from 5, 6, 9, 10Chapter 1: Reconstructing and analyzing arguments  48 12. The only way that the United States can adequately respond to the security threat that Assad poses is by military force. 13. It is in the national security interests of the United States to respond adequately to any national security threat. 14. Therefore, it is in the national security interests of the United States to respond to Assad\u2019s use of chemical weapons with military force. (from 11-13)  In addition to showing the structure of the argument by use of parentheses which show which statements follow from which, we can also diagram the arguments spatially as we did in section 1.4 like this:     This is just another way of representing what I have already represented in the standard form argument, using parentheses to describe the structure. As is perhaps even clearer in the spatial representation of the argument\u2019s structure, this argument is complex in that it has numerous subarguments.",
