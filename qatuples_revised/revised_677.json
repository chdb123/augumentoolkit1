    "What does it mean for two propositions to be connected by a conjunction?",
    "A conjunction connects two propositions with a \"and\" symbol, meaning both must be true for the conjunction to hold.",
    "It is just a matter a keeping track of where you are in the proof and what you\u2019re ultimately trying to derive. So here is a bit more complex proof:  1. (~A v B\u2283 L 2. ~B 3. A \u2283 B 4. L \u2283 (~R v D) 5. ~D \u22c5 (R v F) /\u2234 (L v G) \u22c5 ~R  The conclusion is a conjunction of \u201cL v G\u201d and \u201c~R\u201d so we know that if we can get each of those sentences on a separate line, then we can use the rule conjunction to derive the conclusion. That will be our long range goal here (and this is utilizing the strategy of working backwards). However, we cannot see how to directly get there from here at this point, so we will begin utilizing the strategy of working forward. The first thing we\u2019ll do is simplify the conjunction on line 5:  6. ~D  Simplification 5 Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  110 7. R v F Simplification 5  Look at lines 2 and 6: they are both negated atomic propositions. Another part of the strategy of working forward is to utilize either atomic or negated atomic sentences. We should look for how we can utilize modus tollens or disjunctive syllogism by plugging these negated atomic sentences into other lines of the proof.",
