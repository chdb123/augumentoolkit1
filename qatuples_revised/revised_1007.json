    "What does it mean for two events to be positively correlated?",
    "Two events being positively correlated means that as one event increases, the other also tends to increase, but it doesn't necessarily imply causation.",
    "For example, if as a police department increased the number of police officers on the street, the number of crimes reported Chapter 3: Evaluating inductive arguments and probabilistic and statistical fallacies  165 decreases, then number of police on the street and number of crimes reported would be negatively correlated. In each of these examples, we may think we can directly infer the cause from the correlation\u2014the rising CO2 levels are causing the rising global temperatures and the increasing number of police on the street is causing the crime rate to drop. However, we cannot directly infer causation from correlation. Correlation is not causation. If A and B are positively correlated, then there are four distinct possibilities regarding what the cause is:  1. A is the cause of B 2. B is the cause of A 3. Some third thing, C, is the cause of both A and B increasing 4. The correlation is accidental  In order to infer what causes what in a correlation, we must rely on our general background knowledge (i.e., things we know to be true about the world), our scientific knowledge, and possibly further scientific testing. For example, in the global warming case, there is no scientific theory that explains how rising global temperatures could cause rising levels of CO2 but there is a scientific theory that enables us to understand how rising levels of CO2 could increase average global temperatures. This knowledge makes it plausible to infer that the rising CO2 levels are causing the rising average global temperatures.",
