    "What is the first step in evaluating a categorical syllogism using Venn diagrams?",
    "The first step is to identify the three categories referred in the syllogism.",
    "Let\u2019s try another one. 1. All pediatricians are doctors 2. All pediatricians like children 3. Therefore, all doctors like children. The first step is to identify the three categories referred to in this categorical syllogism. They are:   Pediatricians  Doctors  Things that like children  The next step is to fill out the three category Venn for the premises and the two category Venn for the conclusion. Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  134 This argument does not pass the Venn test of validity because there is information contained in the conclusion Venn that is not contained in the premise Venn. In particular, the conclusion says that there is nothing in the \u201cdoctors\u201d category that is outside the \u201cthings that like children category.\u201d  However, the premises do not represent that information, since the section of the category \u201cdoctors\u201d that lies outside of the intersection of the category \u201cthings that like children\u201d is unshaded, thus representing that there can be things there. Sometimes when filling in particular statements on a three category for the premises, you will encounter a problem that requires another convention in order to accurately represent the information in the Venn. Here is an example where this happens:  1. Some mammals are bears 2. Some two-legged creatures are mammals 3.",
