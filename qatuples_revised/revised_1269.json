    "What is a genetic fallacy?",
    "A genetic fallacy is the error of assessing an idea based on its origin, rather than its merits.",
    "The validity of that mathematical proof stands on its own; the fact that Hitler was a horrible person has nothing to do with whether the proof is good. Likewise with any other idea: ideas must be assessed on their own merits and the origin of an idea is neither a merit nor demerit of the idea. Although genetic fallacies are most often committed when one associates an idea with a negative origin, it can also go the other way: one can imply that because the idea has a positive origin, the idea must be true or more plausible. For example, suppose that Jill argues that the Golden Rule is a good way to live one\u2019s life because the Golden Rule originated with Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount (it didn\u2019t, actually, even though Jesus does state a version of the Golden Rule). Jill has committed the genetic fallacy in assuming that the (presumedChapter 4: Informal fallacies  207 fact that Jesus is the origin of the Golden Rule has anything to do with whether the Golden Rule is a good idea. I\u2019ll end with an example from William James\u2019s seminal work, The Varieties of Religious Experience. In that book (originally a set of lectures), James considers the idea that if religious experiences could be explained in terms of neurological causes, then the legitimacy of the religious experience is undermined.",
