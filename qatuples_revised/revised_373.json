    "What is the difference between a truth-functional connective and a non-truth-functional connective?",
    "A truth-functional connective changes the truth value of propositions in a predictable way (like negation), while a non-truth-functional connective does not.",
    "Unlike the other three, negation does not connect two different propositions. Nonetheless, we call it a truth-functional connective because although it doesn\u2019t actually connect two different propositions, it does change the truth value of propositions in a truth-functional way. That is, if we know the truth value of the proposition we are negating, then we know the truth value of the resulting negated proposition. We can represent this information in the truth table for negation. In the following table, the symbol we will use to represent negation is called the \u201ctilde\u201d (~). (You can find the tilde on the upper left-hand side of your keyboard.Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  60  p ~p T F F T  This truth table represents the meaning of the truth-functional connective, negation, which is represented by the tilde in our symbolic language. The header row of the table represents some proposition p (which could be any proposition) and the negation of that proposition, ~p. What the table says is simply that if a proposition is true, then the negation of that proposition is false (as in the first row of the table); and if a proposition is false, then the negation of that proposition is true (as in the second row of the table). As we have seen, it is easy to form sentences in our symbolic language using the tilde. All we have to do is add a tilde to left-hand side of an existing sentence.",
