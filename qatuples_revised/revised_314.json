    "What is a premise in an argument?",
    "A premise is a statement that supports or provides evidence for another statement, usually the conclusion.",
    "So while statement 11 is a premise of the main argument for the main conclusion (statement 14), statement 11 is also itself a conclusion of a subargument whose premises are statements 5, 6, 9, and 10. And although statement 9 is a premise in that argument, it itself is a conclusion of yet another subargument whose premises are statements 1, 7 and 8. Almost any interesting argument will be complex in this way, with further subarguments in support of the premises of the main argument. Chapter 1: Reconstructing and analyzing arguments  49  This chapter has provided you the tools to be able to reconstruct arguments like these. As we have seen, there is much to consider in reconstructing a complex argument. As with any skill, a true mastery of it requires lots of practice. In many ways, this is a skill that is more like an art than a science. The next chapter will introduce you to some basic formal logic, which is perhaps more like a science than an art. Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  50 2.1 What are formal methods of evaluation and why do we need them? In chapter 1 we introduced the concept of validity and the informal test of validity. According to that test, in order to determine whether an argument is valid we ask whether we can imagine a scenario where the premises are true and yet the conclusion is false. If we can, then the argument is invalid; if we can\u2019t then the argument is valid.",
