    "What is a disjunction in logic?",
    "A disjunction in logic is an operator that groups two or more propositions together, indicating one must be true but not necessarily both.",
    "Clearly B and K are being grouped together with the conjunction \u201cand\u201d and S and T are also being grouped together with the conjunction \u201cand\u201d as well:  (B \u22c5 K (S \u22c5 T)  Furthermore, the main operator of the sentence is a disjunction, which you should be tipped off to by the phrase \u201ceither\u2026or.\u201d Thus, the correct translation of the sentence is:  (B \u22c5 K) v (S \u22c5 T)  The main operator of this sentence is the disjunction (the wedge). Again, it is the main operator because it groups together the two main sentence groupings. Let\u2019s finish this section with one final example. Consider the sentence:  Tom will not wash the dishes and will not help prepare dinner; however, he will vacuum the floor or cut the grass. This sentence contains four atomic propositions:  Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  70  Tom will wash the dishes (W)   Tom will help prepare dinner (P)   Tom will vacuum the floor (V)   Tom will cut the grass (C)  It is clear from the English (because of the \u201cnot\u201d) that we need to negate both W and P. It is also clear from the English (because of the \u201cand\u201d) that W and P are grouped together.",
