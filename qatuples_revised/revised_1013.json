    "In this scenario, Bob\u2019s inebriation is the common cause of both his headache and his clothes being on in bed. Sometimes correlations are merely accidental, meaning that there is no causal relationship between them at all. For example, Tyler Vigen4 reports that the per capita consumption of cheese in the U.S. correlates with the number of people who die by becoming entangled in their bedsheets:        And the number of Mexican lemons imported to the U.S. correlates with the number of traffic fatalities5:                               4 http://tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations 5 Stephen R. Johnson, The Trouble with QSAR (or How I Learned To Stop Worrying and Embrace Fallacy). J. Chem. Inf. Model., 2008, 48 (1), pp. 25\u201326. Chapter 3: Evaluating inductive arguments and probabilistic and statistical fallacies  167   Clearly neither of these correlations are causally related at all\u2014they are accidental correlations. What makes them accidental is that we have no theory that would make sense of how they could be causally related. This just goes to show that it isn\u2019t simply the correlation that allows us to infer a cause, but, rather, some additional background theory, scientific theory, or other evidence that establishes one thing as causing another.",
