    "Why is Jack more likely to draw marbles of all the same color than Jill?",
    "Jack is more likely to draw marbles of all the same color because he draws only 3 marbles at a time, while Jill draws 10. Smaller samples are less representative of the population and thus less likely to show extremes like drawing all red or all white.",
    "Who is more likely to draw either all red or all white marbles more often: Jack or Jill?10                               9 This example taken from Kahneman (2011), op. cit., p. 109. 10 This example is also taken (with minor modificationsfrom Kahneman (2011), p. 110. Chapter 3: Evaluating inductive arguments and probabilistic and statistical fallacies  183 The answer here should be obvious: Jack is more likely to draw marbles of all the same color more often, since Jack is only drawing 3 marbles at a time. Since Jill is drawing 10 marbles at a time, it will be less likely that her draws will yield marbles of all the same color. This is simply a fact of sampling and is related to the sampling errors discussed in section 3.1. A sample that is too small will tend not to be representative of the population. In the marbles case, if we view Jack\u2019s draws as samples, then his samples will be far less representative of the ratio of marbles in the jar. Jill, on the other hand, will tend to get far more representative samples. Since Jill is drawing a larger number of marbles, it is less likely that her samples would be drastically off in the way Jack\u2019s would be. The general point to be taken from this example is that smaller samples tend to the extremes\u2014both in terms of overrepresenting some feature (e.g., red marbles) and in underrepresenting that same feature.",
