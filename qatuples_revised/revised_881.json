    "If your car's tire was flat and there were no other signs of damage, what might be a reasonable inference for its cause?",
    "A nail puncture or a slow leak could be a reasonable inference, as it explains the flat tire without requiring additional assumptions. Other possibilities like a stray baseball or a thief would need more evidence to be considered likely.",
    "3.2 Inference to the best explanation and the seven explanatory virtues  Explanations help us to understand why something happened, not simply convince us that something happened (see chapter 1, section 1.3). However, there is a common kind of inductive argument that takes the best explanation of why x occurred as an argument for the claim that x occurred. For example, suppose that your car window is broken and your iPod (which you left visible in the front seatis missing. The immediate inference you would probably make is that someone broke the window of your car and stole your iPod. What makes this a reasonable inference? What makes it a reasonable inference is that this explanation explains all the relevant facts (broken window, missing iPod) and does so better than any other competing explanation. In this case, it is perhaps possible that a stray baseball broke your window, but since (let us suppose) there is no baseball diamond close by, and people don\u2019t play catch in the parking garage you are parked in, this seems unlikely. Moreover, the baseball scenario doesn\u2019t explain why the iPod is gone. Of course, it could be that some inanimate object broke your window and then someone saw the iPod and took it. Or perhaps a dog jumped into the window that was broken by a stray baseball and ate your iPod. These are all possibilities, but they are remote and thus much less likely explanations of the facts at hand. The much better explanation is that a thief both broke the window and took the iPod.",
