    "How strong is the argument based on shared humanity for expecting similar perception?",
    "The argument is strong, but not conclusive, as it relies on analogy and may be affected by the problem of other minds. We share physiology and perceptual systems, so we should expect similar perceptions, but we cannot know for sure if others have the same experiences.",
    "So it is the pace at which one runs, rather than the number of miles one runs, that is the better predictor of how fast one can run a race. 14. Strong. The fact that we are both humans is relevant to determining whether someone will feel pain. Humans all have similar physiology, which is why we should expect that if x causes one person physical pain, then x will also cause anyone else a similar pain. (However, this argument also raises a famous problem in philosophy of mind called \u201cthe problem of other minds.\u201d The issue is whether or not we can ever know that people have mental states, such as pain, like my own. Even if you exhibit pain behavior in similar instances in which I experience pain, how do I know that you are actually feeling what I am feeling\u2014that you are having the experience of pain, rather than simply exhibiting pain behavior without have the mental experience of it? Many philosophers have argued that we cannot overcome this problem and must admit that we cannot know whether people other than ourselves actually have mental states like ours.15. Again, the common sense answer would be that this is a strong argument based on a strong analogy. Since you and I are both human and share similar perceptual systems, we should expect that we will perceive the world very similarly (even if not exactly the same). (However, we can raise the same \u201cproblem of other minds\u201d problem here as I did in #14 above. Suppose we both point at the grass and say that it is green.",
