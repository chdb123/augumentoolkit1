    "What are the two fallacies related to vagueness in logical reasoning?",
    "The two fallacies related to vagueness are the causal slippery slope and the conceptual slippery slope. The conceptual slippery slope is when one cannot draw a distinction between A and B, nor between B and C, but assumes there's no distinction between A and C.",
    "), moral concepts (right, wrong, good, bad), and just about any other concept you can think of. The one domain that seems to be unaffected by vagueness is mathematical and logical concepts. There are two fallacies related to vagueness: the causal slippery slope and the conceptual slippery slope. We\u2019ll cover the conceptual slippery slope first since it relates most closely to the concept of vagueness I\u2019ve explained above. 4.2.1 Conceptual slippery slope  It may be true that there is no essential difference between 499 grains of sand and 500 grains of sand. But even if that is so, it doesn\u2019t follow that there is no difference between 1 grain of sand and 5 billion grains of sand. In general, just because we cannot draw a distinction between A and B, and we cannot draw a distinction between B and C, it doesn\u2019t mean we cannot draw a distinction between A and C. Here is an example of a conceptual slippery slope fallacy. It is illegal for anyone under 21 to drink alcohol. But there is no difference between someone who is 21 and someone who is 20 years 11 months old. So there is nothing wrong with someone who is 20 years and 11 months old drinking. But since there is no real distinction between being one month older and one month younger, there shouldn\u2019t be anything wrong with drinking at any age.",
