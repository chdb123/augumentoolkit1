    "Should you erase the 'A v B' column once the truth values of the main operator are determined?",
    "Yes, it is recommended to erase the 'A v B' column once the truth values of the main operator are determined, as they are no longer needed for further analysis. This helps focus on the relevant information.",
    "A B C (A v Bv C ~A C T T T        T   T T F        T   T F T        T    T F F        T    F T T        T   F T F        T   F F T        F   F F F        F    Now, since we have figured out the truth values of the left disjunct, we can figure out the truth values under the main operator (which I have emphasized in bold in the truth table below). The two columns you are looking at to determine the truth values of the main operator are the \u201cA v B\u201d column that we have just figured out above and the \u201cC\u201d reference column to the left. It is imperative to understand that the truth values under the \u201cA v B\u201d are irrelevant once we have figured out the truth values under the main operator of the sentence. That column was only a means to an end (the end of determining the main operator) and so I have grayed those out to emphasize that we are no longer paying any attention to them. (When you are constructing your own truth tables, you may even want to erase these subsidiary columns once you\u2019ve determined the truth values of the main operator of the sentence.",
