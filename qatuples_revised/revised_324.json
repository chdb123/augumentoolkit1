    "What does it mean to evaluate an argument by its form rather than its content?",
    "To evaluate an argument by its form means to assess its structure or logical validity without considering the truth of the statements made within it.",
    "As we will see by the end of this chapter, logicians have devised a number of formal techniques that accomplish this goal for certain classes of arguments. What all of these formal techniques have in common is that you can apply them without really having to understand the meanings of the concepts used in the argument. Furthermore, you can apply the formal techniques without having to utilize imagination at all. Thus, the formal techniques we will survey in this chapter help address the lack of precision and objectivity inherent in the informal test of validity. In general, a formal method of evaluation is a method of evaluation of arguments that does not require one to understand the meaning of the statements involved in the argument. Although at this point this may sound like gibberish, after we have Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  51 introduced the formal methods, you will understand what it means to evaluate an argument without knowing what the statements of the argument mean. By the end of this chapter, if not before, you will understand what it means to evaluate an argument by its form, rather than its content. However, I will give you a sense of what a formal method of evaluation is in a very simple case right now, to give you a foretaste of what we will be doing in this chapter. Suppose I tell you:  It is sunny and warm today. This statement is a conjunction because it is a complex statement that is asserting two things:  It is sunny today. It is warm today.",
