    "What are the components of an argument, and how do premise indicators and conclusion indicators fit into it?",
    "An argument has a premise (reasonand a conclusion. Premise indicators signal reasons, and conclusion indicators signal the statement intended to be established as true.",
    "That is, \u201cbecause\u201d indicates that what follows is a reason for thinking that abortion is morally wrong. Here is another example:  I know that the student plagiarized since I found the exact same sentences on a website and the website was published more than a year before the student wrote the paper. In this example, the word \u201csince\u201d is a premise indicator because what follows it is a statement that is clearly intended to be a reason for thinking that the student plagiarized (i.e., a premise). Notice that in these two cases, the premise indicators \u201cbecause\u201d and \u201csince\u201d are interchangeable: I could have used \u201cbecause\u201d in place of \u201csince\u201d or \u201csince\u201d in the place of \u201cbecause\u201d and the meaning of the sentences would have been the same. In addition to premise indicators, there are also conclusion indicators. Conclusion indicators mark that what follows is the conclusion of an argument. For example,   Bob-the-arsonist has been dead for a year, so Bob-the-arsonist didn\u2019t set the fire at the East Lansing Starbucks last week. In this example, the word \u201cso\u201d is a conclusion indicator because what follows it is a statement that someone is trying to establish as true (i.e., a conclusion). Here is another example of a conclusion indicator:  A poll administered by Gallup (a respected polling companyshowed candidate x to be substantially behind candidate y with only a week left before the vote, therefore candidate y will probably not win the election.",
