    "How do you determine the truth value of a compound proposition with multiple connectives?",
    "Determine the truth values of each atomic proposition, then apply the truth-functional connective(saccording to the sentence's logic. If there are multiple connectives, use De Morgan's laws or the distributive law as needed.",
    "(M = It will rain on Monday; T = It will rain on Tuesday7. Tom does not like cheesecake. (T = Tom likes cheesecake) 8. Bob would like to have both a large cat and a small dog as a pet. (C = Bob would like to have a large cat as a pet; D = Bob would like to have a small dog as a pet) 9. Bob Saget is not actually very funny. (B = Bob Saget is very funny) 10. Albert Einstein did not believe in God. (A = Albert Einstein believed in God)   2.4 Using parentheses to translate complex sentences  We have seen how to translate certain simple sentences into our symbolic language using the dot, wedge, and tilde. The process of translation starts with determining what the atomic propositions of the sentence are and then using the truth functional connectives to form the compound proposition. Sometimes this will be fairly straightforward and easy to figure out\u2014especially if there is only one truth-functional operator used in the English sentence. However, many sentences will contain more than one truth-functional operator. Here is an example:  Bob will not go to class but will play video games. What are the atomic propositions contained in this English sentence?",
