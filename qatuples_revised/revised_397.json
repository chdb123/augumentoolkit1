    "Translate the following English sentence into our formal language using conjunction (the dot), negation (the tilde), or disjunction (the wedge): Either Bob will mop or Tom will mop.",
    "B \u2228 T (Using the suggested constants, this represents either Bob will mop or Tom will mop.)",
    "When you believe the best interpretation of a disjunction is as an exclusive or, there are ways to represent that using a combination of the disjunction, conjunction and negation. The reason we interpret the wedge as an inclusive or rather than an exclusive or is that while we can build an exclusive or out of a combination of an inclusive or and other truth-functional connectives (as I\u2019ve just pointed out), there is no way to build an inclusive or out of the exclusive or and other truth-functional connectives. We will see how to represent an exclusive or in section 2.5. Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  64 Exercise 9: Translate the following English sentences into our formal language using conjunction (the dot), negation (the tilde), or disjunction (the wedge). Use the suggested constants to stand for the atomic propositions. 1. Either Bob will mop or Tom will mop. (B = Bob will mop; T = Tom will mop2. It is not sunny today. (S = it is sunny today) 3. It is not the case that Bob is a burglar. (B = Bob is a burglar) 4. Harry is arriving either tonight or tomorrow night. (A = Harry is arriving tonight; B = Harry is arriving tomorrow night) 5. Gareth does not like his name. (G = Gareth likes his name) 6. Either it will not rain on Monday or it will not rain on Tuesday.",
