    "How does the argument depend on a normative statement?",
    "The argument depends on the normative statement to justify the conclusion, which is also normative. In this case, the missing premise \"The state should always do what it can to decrease harm to children\" justifies the conclusion that the state should discourage gay couples from raising children.",
    "However, suppose that in that society people do not accept that the state should do what it can to decrease harm to children. In this case, the conclusion, that the state should discourage gay couples from raising children, does not follow. Thus, we can see that the argument depends on a missing or assumed premise that is not explicitly stated. That missing premise must be a normative statement, in order that we can infer the conclusion, which is also a normative statement. There is an important general lesson here: Many times an argument with a normative conclusion will depend on a normative premise which is not explicitly stated. The missing normative premise of this particular argument seems to be something like this:   The state should always do what it can to decrease harm to children. Notice that this is a normative statement, which is indicated by the use of the word \u201cshould.\u201d There are many other words that can be used to capture normative statements such as: good, bad, and ought. Thus, we can reconstruct the argument, filling in the missing normative premise like this:  1. Children who are raised by gay couples often have psychological and emotional problems. 2. The state should always do what it can to decrease harm to children. 3. Therefore, the state should discourage gay couples from raising children. (from 1-2 However, although the argument is now in better shape, it is still invalid because it is still possible for the premises to be true and yet the conclusion false.",
