    "What are the two categories used in translating the sentence 'baboons are fearsome beasts' into a categorical form?",
    "The two categories are \"baboons\" and \"fearsome beasts.\"",
    "This English sentence has the sense of \u201cbaboons are fearsome beasts\u201d rather than of \u201cthat (particularbaboon is a fearsome beast.\u201d English is strange, which is what makes translation one of the trickiest parts of logic. So, the two categories are: \u201cbaboons\u201d and \u201cfearsome beasts.\u201d Notice that since \u201cfearsome beasts\u201d is already a noun phrase, we don\u2019t have to add \u201cthings that are\u2026\u201d to it. Using the two category descriptions, the translation into the \u201call S are P\u201d categorical form is thus:   All baboons are fearsome beasts. In this section we have learned what categorical statement are, how to translate categorical statements into one of the four categorical forms, and how to construct Venn diagrams for each of the four categorical forms. The following exercises will give you some practice with the translation part; in subsequent sections we will learn how to use Venn diagrams as a formal method of evaluating a certain class of arguments. Exercise 18: Translate each of the following sentences into one of the four categorical forms (universal affirmative, universal negative, particular affirmative, particular negative). Make sure that the descriptions of the two categories are nouns or noun phrases (rather than adjectives or verbs). 1. Real men wear pink. 2. Dinosaurs are not birds. 3. Birds evolved from dinosaurs.",
