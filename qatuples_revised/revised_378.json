    "The next truth-functional connective to be introduced after conjunction is disjunction. In later sections, it will be learned how to form complex propositions using various combinations of each of the four truth-functional connectives.",
    "For example, we could represent the statement \u201cCincinnati is the capital of Ohio\u201d using the capital letter C, which is called a constant. In propositional logic, a constant is a capital letter that represents an atomic proposition. In that case, we could represent the statement \u201cCincinnati is not the capital of Ohio\u201d like this:   ~C  Likewise, we could represent the statement \u201cToledo is the capital of Ohio\u201d using the constant T. In that case, we could represent the statement \u201cToledo is not the capital of Ohio\u201d like this:  ~T  We could also create a sentence that is a conjunction of these two negations, like this:  ~C \u22c5 ~T  Can you figure out what this complex proposition says? (Think about it; you should be able to figure it out given your understanding of the truth-functional connectives, negation and conjunction.The propositions says (literally): \u201cCincinnati is not the capital of Ohio and Toledo is not the capital of Ohio.\u201d In later sections we will learn how to form complex propositions using various Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  61 combinations of each of the four truth-functional connectives. Before we can do that, however, we need to introduce our next truth-functional connective, disjunction.",
