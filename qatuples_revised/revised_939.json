    "What is the key condition for a good argument from analogy?",
    "The key condition for any good argument from analogy is that the similarities between the things being compared in the analogy must be relevant to the characteristic cited in the conclusion.",
    "Since it is possible that car companies can retain their name and yet drastically alter the quality of the parts and assembly of the car, it is clear that the name of the car isn\u2019t itself what establishes the quality of the car. Thus, the original argument, which invoked merely that the new car was a Subaru is not as strong as the argument that the car was Chapter 3: Evaluating inductive arguments and probabilistic and statistical fallacies  156 constructed with the same quality parts and quality assembly as the other cars I\u2019d owned (and that had been reliable for me). What this illustrates is that better arguments from analogy will invoke more relevant similarities between the things being compared in the analogy. This is a key condition for any good argument from analogy: the similar characteristics between the two things cited in the premises must be relevant to the characteristic cited in the conclusion. Here is an ethical argument that is an argument from analogy.1 Suppose that Bob uses his life savings to buy an expensive sports car. One day Bob parks his car and takes a walk along a set of train tracks. As he walks, he sees in the distance a small child whose leg has become caught in the train tracks. Much to his alarm, he sees a train coming towards the child. Unfortunately, the train will reach the child before he can (since it is moving very fastand he knows it will be unable to stop in time and will kill the child.",
