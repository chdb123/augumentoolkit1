    "How does the example in the text illustrate the causal slippery slope fallacy?",
    "The example shows how imitating someone can lead to meeting undesirables, marrying them, and having a grandson with a dog collar, implying that using cable will also result in a grandson with a dog collar. This assumes that each link is probable, but doesn't consider the overall probability of the chain.",
    "When your daughter imitates you, she will probably get thrown out of school. When she gets thrown out of school, she will probably meet undesirables. When she meets undesirables, she will probably marry undesirables. When she marries undesirables, you will probably have a grandson with a dog collar. Therefore, if you use cable, you will probably have a grandson with a dog collar. This example is silly and absurd, yes. But it illustrates the causal slippery slope fallacy. Slippery slope fallacies are always made up of a series of conjunctions of probabilistic conditional statements that link the first event to the last event. A causal slippery slope fallacy is committed when one assumes that just because each individual conditional statement is probable, the conditional that links the first event to the last event is also probable. Even if we grant that each \u201clink\u201d in the chain is individually probable, it doesn\u2019t follow that the whole chain (or the conditional that links the first event to the last eventis probable. Suppose, for the sake of the argument, we assign probabilities to each \u201clink\u201d or conditional statement, like this. (I have italicized the consequents of the conditionals and assigned high conditional probabilities to them. The high probability is for the sake of the argument; I don\u2019t actually think these things are as probable as I\u2019ve assumed here.)",
