    "How does the truth table support the validity of modus ponens?",
    "The truth table shows that if both premises (p and p \u2283 qare true, then the conclusion (q) must also be true. There is no row where this is not the case, so it passes the test for validity.",
    "\u2234 q  What this form says, in words, is that if we have asserted a conditional statement (p \u2283 qand we have also asserted the antecedent of that conditional statement Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  97 (p), then we are entitled to infer the consequent of that conditional statement (q). For example, if I asserted the conditional, \u201cif it is raining, then the ground is wet\u201d and I also asserted \u201cit is raining\u201d (the antecedent of that conditional) then I (or anyone else, for that matter) am entitled to assert the consequent of the conditional, \u201cthe ground is wet.\u201d   As with any valid forms of inference in this section, we can prove that modus ponens is valid by constructing a truth table. As you see from the truth table below, this argument form passes the truth table test of validity (since there is no row of the truth table on which the premises are all true and yet the conclusion is false). p q p \u2283 q p q T T T T T T F F T F F T T F T F F T F F   Thus, any argument that has this same form is valid. For example, the following argument also has this same form (modus ponens):  1.",
