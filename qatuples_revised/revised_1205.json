    "What is the conceptual slippery slope fallacy?",
    "The conceptual slippery slope fallacy assumes that because we cannot draw a distinction between adjacent stages, we cannot draw a distinction at all between any stages.",
    "Therefore, there is nothing wrong with allowing a 10 year old to drink alcohol. Imagine the life of an individual in stages of 1 month intervals. Even if it is true that there is no distinction in kind between any one of those stages, it doesn\u2019t follow that there isn\u2019t a distinction to be drawn at the extremes of either end. Clearly there is a difference between a 5 year old and a 25 year old\u2014a distinction in kind that is relevant to whether they should be allowed to drink alcohol. The conceptual slippery slope fallacy assumes that because we cannot draw a distinction between adjacent stages, we cannot draw a distinction at all between any stages. One clear way of illustrating this is with color. Think of a color spectrum from purple to red to orange to yellow to green to blue. Each color grades into the next without there being any distinguishable boundaries Chapter 4: Informal fallacies  198 between the colors\u2014a continuous spectrum. Even if it is true that for any two adjacent hues on the color wheel, we cannot distinguish between the two, it doesn\u2019t follow from this that there is no distinction to be drawn between any two portions of the color wheel, because then we\u2019d be committed to saying that there is no distinguishable difference between purple and yellow! The example of the color spectrum illustrates the general point that just because the boundaries between very similar things on a spectrum are vague, it doesn\u2019t follow that there are no differences between any two things on that spectrum.",
