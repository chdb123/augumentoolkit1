    "How does the 'and only if there is no case' clause relate to joint sufficiency?",
    "It means that both candidates must be present for the target feature to occur, otherwise it's not jointly sufficient.",
    "Although no one feature is sufficient for causing the seizures (according to the data we have gathered so far), it is still possible that certain features are jointly sufficient. Two candidate features are jointly sufficient for a target feature if and only if there is no case in which both candidates are present                              3 This discussion draws heavily on chapter 10, pp. 220-224 of Sinnott-Armstrong and Fogelin\u2019s Understanding Arguments, 9th edition (Cengage Learning). Chapter 3: Evaluating inductive arguments and probabilistic and statistical fallacies  163 and yet the target is absent. Applying this test, we can see that B and C are jointly sufficient for the target feature since any time both are present, the target feature is always present. Thus, from the data we have gathered so far, we can say that the likely cause of Charlie\u2019s seizures are when we both give him a bath and then follow that bath up with a flea treatment. Every time those two things occur, he has a seizure (sufficient condition); and every time he has a seizure, those two things occur (necessary condition). Thus, the data gathered so far supports the following causal conditional:   Any time Charlie is given a shampoo bath and a flea treatment, he has a seizure. Although in the above case, the necessary and sufficient conditions were the same, this needn\u2019t always be the case. Sometimes sufficient conditions are not necessary conditions.",
