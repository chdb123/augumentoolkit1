    "How is the example of Peter Singer's argument connected to an ad hominem fallacy?",
    "Instead of addressing his argument that it is morally wrong to spend on luxuries when children die from preventable deaths, someone attacked him personally.",
    "4.3.1 Ad hominem   \u201cAd hominem\u201d is a Latin phrase that can be translated into English as the phrase, \u201cagainst the man.\u201d In an ad hominem fallacy, instead of responding to (or attackingthe argument a person has made, one attacks the person him or herself. In short, one attacks the person making the argument rather than the argument itself. Here is an anecdote that reveals an ad hominem fallacy (and that has actually occurred in my ethics class before). A philosopher named Peter Singer had made an argument that it is morally wrong to spend money on luxuries for oneself rather than give all of your money that you don\u2019t strictly need away to charity. The argument is actually an argument from analogy (whose details I discussed in section 3.3), but the essence of the argument is that there are every day in this world children who die from preventable deaths, and there are charities Chapter 4: Informal fallacies  202 who could save the lives of these children if they are funded by individuals from wealthy countries like our own.",
