    "How do propositions 12, 13, and 14 on page 56 of 'Introduction to Logic and Critical Thinking' differ from each other?",
    "Propositions 12, 13, and 14 all state that T (that plant has three leaves), but they differ in their conclusions: proposition 12 implies ~W (Bekele is sick), proposition 13 implies P (T is true), and proposition 14 implies W (Bekele will win the race). The difference lies in their negations and conclusions.",
