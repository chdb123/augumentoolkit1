    "How does the spending on $5 espressos from Biggby's or Starbuck's relate to the moral dilemma where Bob chose self-interest over saving a life in 'Introduction to Logic and Critical Thinking'?",
    "They are a want, as they are not essential for survival or wellbeing. The text compares such spending habits to Bob's decision in the moral dilemma, where he chose self-interest over saving a life. This suggests that both actions can be questioned morally.",
    "At just that moment, he sees a switch near him that he can throw to change the direction of the tracks and divert the train onto another set of tracks so that it won\u2019t hit the child. Unfortunately, Bob sees that he has unwittingly parked his car on that other set of tracks and that if he throws the switch, his expensive car will be destroyed. Realizing this, Bob decides not to throw the switch and the train strikes and kills the child, leaving his car unharmed. What should we say of Bob? Clearly, that was a horrible thing for Bob to do and we would rightly judge him harshly for doing it. In fact, given the situation described, Bob would likely be criminally liable. Now consider the following situation in which you, my reader, likely find yourself (whether you know it or not\u2014well, now you do know it). Each week you spend money on things that you do not need. For example, I sometimes buy $5 espressos from Biggby\u2019s or Starbuck\u2019s. I do not need to have them and I could get a much cheaper caffeine fix, if I chose to (for example, I could make a strong cup of coffee at my office and put sweetened hazelnut creamer in it). In any case, I really don\u2019t need the caffeine at all! And yet I regularly purchase these $5 drinks. (If $5 drinks aren\u2019t the thing you spend money on, but in no way need, then fill in the example with whatever it is that fits your own life.)",
