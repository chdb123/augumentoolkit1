    "What does it mean for an argument to be valid?",
    "A valid argument means that if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.",
    "\u2234 Some S are P  If we think about mapping the first premise on our three category Venn, it seems that we will have to utilize the convention we just introduced, since the first premise is a particular categorical statement that mentions only the categories S and M and nothing about the category P:    However, as it turns out, we don\u2019t have to use this convention because when we map premise 2, which is a universal statement, this clears up where the asterisk has to go:  Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  138   We can see that once we\u2019ve mapped the universal statement onto the premise Venn (on the left), there is only one section where the asterisk can go that is in the intersection of S and M. The reason is that once we have mapped the \u201call M are P\u201d premise, and have thus shaded out any portion of the M category that is outside the P category, we know that that asterisk cannot belong inside the M category, given that it has to be inside the P category. When we apply the Venn test of validity to the above argument, we can see that it is valid since the conclusion Venn does not contain any information that isn\u2019t already contained in the premise Venn. The conclusion simply says that there is some thing that is both S and P, and that information is already represented in our premise Venn. Thus, the argument is valid.",
