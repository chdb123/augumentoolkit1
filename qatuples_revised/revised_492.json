    "Using the provided argument and truth table, explain why the argument is valid.",
    "The argument is valid because there is no row in which all premises are true and yet the conclusion is false. In the first row, ~S is false; in the second row, both premises and conclusion are true; in the third row, all premises are true and so is the conclusion. Thus, it's impossible for all premises to be true while conclusion is false.",
    "You should see that these definitions of validity and invalidity have a similar structure to the informal definitions of validity and invalidity (discussed in chapter 1). The similarity is that we are looking for the possibility that the premises are true and yet the conclusion is false. If this is possible, then the argument is invalid; if it isn\u2019t possible, then the argument is valid. The difference, as I\u2019ve noted above, is that with the truth table test of validity, we replace having to use your imagination with a mechanical procedure of assigning truth values to atomic propositions and then determining the truth values of the premises and conclusion for each of those assignments. Applying these definitions to the above truth table, we can see that the argument is valid because there is no assignment of truth values to the atomic propositions (i.e., no row of our truth tableon which all the premises are true and yet the conclusion is false. Look at the first row. Is that a row in which all the premises are true and yet the conclusion false? No, it isn\u2019t, because not all the premises are true in that row. In particular, \u201c~S\u201d is false in that row. Look at the second row. Is that a row in which all the premises are true and yet the conclusion false? No, it isn\u2019t; although both premises are true in that row, the conclusion is also true in that row. Now consider the third row. Is that a row in which all the premises are true and yet the conclusion false?",
