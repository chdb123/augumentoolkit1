    "What is the probability of drawing a queen after returning it to the pile and reshuffling the deck?",
    "The probability of drawing a queen after returning it to the pile and reshuffling the deck is 1/52, as there are still four queens in the deck and 52 cards total. This assumes no memory of previously drawn cards.",
    "In comparison, my chances of picking any \u201cface\u201d card would be much higher. There are three face cards in each suit and four different suits, which means there are 12 face cards total. So, 12/52 = .23 or 23%. In any case, the important thing here is that probabilities can be expressed numerically. In using a numerical scheme to represent probabilities, we take 0 to represent an impossible event (such as a contradictionand 1 to represent an event that is certain (such as a tautology). Chapter 3: Evaluating inductive arguments and probabilistic and statistical fallacies  171 Probability is important to understand because it provides the basis for formal methods of evaluating inductive arguments. While there is no universally agreed upon method of evaluating inductive arguments in the way there is with deductive arguments, there are some basic laws of probability that it is important to keep in mind. As we will see in the next few sections, although these laws of probability are seemingly simple, we misapply them all the time. We can think of the rules of probability in terms of some of the truth functional operators, introduced in chapter 2: the probability of conjunctions, the probability of negations, and the probability of disjunctions. The probability of conjunctions is the probability that two, independent events will both occur. For example, what is the probability that you randomly draw a queen and then (after returning it to the pile and reshuffling the deck) you draw another queen?",
