    "What makes an argument invalid?",
    "An argument can be invalid due to false premises, lack of evidence, or faulty reasoning (e.g., affirming the consequent). The example provided is a case of affirming the consequent: assuming that because Bob ate crab Rangoon and he will have stomach troubles, he must have stomach troubles now.)",
    "Therefore, probably anyone who eats crab Rangoon at China Food restaurant will have stomach troubles afterward. (from 13. Bob ate the crab Rangoon at China Food restaurant. 4. Therefore, Bob will probably have stomach troubles afterward. (from 2-3) 9. 1. Albert and Caroline like to run together. 2. Albert never runs without Caroline. 3. Therefore, any time Albert is running, so is Caroline. (from 1-2) 4. Albert is panting hard. 5. Therefore, Albert looks like he has just run (from 4) 6. Therefore, Caroline has probably just ran as well. (from 3, 5) 10. 1. Jeremy\u2019s prints would be expected to be on his own gun. 2. Someone could have stolen Jeremy\u2019s gun and used it to kill Tim. 3. Therefore, just because Jeremy\u2019s prints were on the gun that killed Tim and the gun was registered to Tim, it doesn\u2019t follow that Jeremy killed Tim. (from 1-2)  Exercise 5 (Note: there are many possible counterexamples to the arguments that are invalid; you don\u2019t have to have the counterexamples I provide to be correct.) 1. Invalid. Counterexample: Katie is severely mentally handicapped and so is not smarter than a chimpanzee. Answers to exercises  212 2. Invalid.",
