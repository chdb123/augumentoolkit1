    "What is the order of the lines used to construct a proof when working forwards?",
    "The order should be from the conclusion to the premises, using the rules cited in reverse.",
    "So, I have to find the lines that contained \u201cT v L\u201d and \u201cR \u22c5 S\u201d and cite those lines. It does not matter the order in which you cite the lines as along as you have cited the correct lines (e.g., I could have equally well have written, \u201cConjunction 3, 1\u201d as the justification). Thus the complete proof should look like this:  1. R \u22c5 S 2. T  /\u2234 (T v L\u22c5 (R \u22c5 S) 3. T v L  Addition 2 Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  108 4. (T v L) \u22c5 (R \u22c5 S) Conjunction 1, 3  That\u2019s it. That is all there is to constructing a proof. The last line of the proof is the conclusion to be derived: check. Each line of the proof follows by the rule and the line(s) cited: check. Since both of those requirements check out, our proof is complete and correct. I have just walked you through a simple proof using the strategy of working backwards. This strategy works well as long as the conclusion we are trying to derive is complex\u2014that is, if it contains truth functional connectives. However, sometimes our conclusion will simply be an atomic statement. In that case, we will not as easily be able to utilize the strategy of working backwards. But there is another strategy that we can utilize: the strategy of working forward.",
