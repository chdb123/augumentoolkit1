    "Considering the following scenario: A convict escaped either by crawling through the sewage pipes or hiding out in the back of the delivery truck. The convict did not escape by crawling through the sewage pipes. Therefore, the convict escaped by hiding out in the back of the delivery truck. Is this argument valid?",
    "Yes, this argument is valid because if we assume the first premise and the second premise are true, the conclusion must follow. This can also be proven using a truth table or symbolic language translation.",
    "This is what logicians call \u201cpropositional logic\u201d or \u201csentential logic.\u201d   In the first chapter, we learned the informal test of validity, which required us to try to imagine a scenario in which the premises of the argument were true and yet the conclusion false. We saw that if we can imagine such a scenario, then the argument is invalid. On the other hand, if it is not possible to imagine a scenario in which the premises are true and yet the conclusion is false, then the argument is valid. Consider this argument:  1. The convict escaped either by crawling through the sewage pipes or by hiding out in the back of the delivery truck. 2. But the convict did not escape by crawling through the sewage pipes. 3. Therefore, the convict escaped by hiding out in the back of the delivery truck. Using the informal test of validity, we can see that if we imagine that the first premise and the second premise are true, then the conclusion must follow. However, we can also prove this argument is valid without having to imagine scenarios and ask whether the conclusion would be true in those scenarios. We can do this by atranslating this sentence into our symbolic language and then b) using a truth table to determine whether the argument is valid. Let\u2019s start with the translation. The first premise contains two atomic propositions.",
