    "What is an inductive argument according to Introduction to Logic and Critical Thinking by Matthew Van Cleave?",
    "An inductive argument is a type of logical argument where the premises could all be true and yet the conclusion false.",
    "Notice that this is an inductive argument because the premises could all be true and yet the conclusion false. Just because something is reasonable, doesn\u2019t mean it is true. After all, sometimes things happen in the world that defy our reason. So perhaps the baseball-dog hypothesis was actually true. In that case, the premises of the argument would still be true (after all, the thief hypothesis is still more reasonable than the baseball-dog hypothesisand yet the conclusion would be false. But the fact that the argument is not a deductive argument isn\u2019t a defect of the argument, because inference to the best explanation arguments are not intended to be deductive arguments, but inductive arguments. As we saw in chapter 1, inductive arguments can be strong even if the premises don\u2019t entail the conclusion. That isn\u2019t a defect of an inductive argument, it is simply a definition of what an inductive argument is! As we\u2019ve seen, in order to make a strong inference to the best explanation, the favored explanation must be the best (or the most reasonable). But what makes an explanation reasonable? There are certain conditions that any good explanation must meet. The more of these conditions are met, the better the explanation. The first, and perhaps most obvious condition, is that the hypothesis proposed must actually explain all the observed facts.",
