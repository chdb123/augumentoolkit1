    "How do the premises and conclusion compare in terms of information represented?",
    "The premise Venn includes all the information from the conclusion Venn, but the conclusion Venn only contains information about humans.",
    "So we must shade out all of the parts of the \u201cthings that are mortal\u201d category the lie outside the \u201cthings that die\u201d category, like this:     The next thing we have to do is construct a two category Venn for the conclusion and then compare the information represented by the three category Venn for the premises to the two category Venn for the conclusion. The conclusion represents the information that there is nothing in the \u201chumans\u201d category that isn\u2019t also in the \u201cthings that die\u201d category. It also allows that there are things that die, but that aren\u2019t humans. The premise Venn also includes this same information, since every part of the \u201chumans\u201d category that is outside the Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  133 \u201cthings that die\u201d category is shaded out. Thus, this argument passes the Venn test of validity and is thus valid since there is no information represented in the conclusion Venn that is not also represented in the premise Venn. Notice that it doesn\u2019t matter that the premise Venn contains more information than the conclusion Venn. That is to be expected, since the premise Venn is representing a whole other category that the conclusion Venn isn\u2019t. This is perfectly allowable. What isn\u2019t allowable (and thus would make an argument fail the Venn test of validityis if the conclusion Venn contained information that wasn\u2019t already contained in the premise Venn. However, since this argument does not do that, it is valid.",
