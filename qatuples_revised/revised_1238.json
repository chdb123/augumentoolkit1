    "An ad hominem fallacy is a logical fallacy where one attacks the person making an argument instead of addressing their argument, often by questioning their character or actions.",
    "Since there are things that we all regularly buy that we don\u2019t need (e.g., Starbuck\u2019s lattes, beer, movie tickets, or extra clothes or shoes we don\u2019t really need), if we continue to purchase those things rather than using that money to save the lives of children, then we are essentially contributing to the deaths of those children if we choose to continue to live our lifestyle of buying things we don\u2019t need, rather than donating the money to a charity that will save lives of children in need. In response to Singer\u2019s argument, one student in the class asked: \u201cDoes Peter Singer give his money to charity? Does he do what he says we are all morally required to do?\u201d  The implication of this student\u2019s question (which I confirmed by following up with herwas that if Peter Singer himself doesn\u2019t donate all his extra money to charities, then his argument isn\u2019t any good and can be dismissed. But that would be to commit an ad hominem fallacy. Instead of responding to the argument that Singer had made, this student attacked Singer himself. That is, they wanted to know how Singer lived and whether he was a hypocrite or not. Was he the kind of person who would tell us all that we had to live a certain way but fail to live that way himself? But all of this is irrelevant to assessing Singer\u2019s argument. Suppose that Singer didn\u2019t donate his excess money to charity and instead spent it on luxurious things for himself.",
