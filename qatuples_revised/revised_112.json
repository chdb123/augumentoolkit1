    "What does it mean for an argument to be in standard form?",
    "An argument in standard form is a clear presentation of premises and conclusion, where each premise supports the conclusion logically. It uses 'if...then' statements to show cause-and-effect relationships between premises.",
    "Here is another way of paraphrasing the premises and putting the argument into standard form:  1. Tim was killed by a gun that was registered to Jeremy and had Jeremy\u2019s prints on it. 2. It is possible that Jeremy\u2019s gun was stolen from him. 3. If Jeremy\u2019s gun was stolen from him, then Jeremy could not have killed Tim. 4. Therefore, we do not know that Jeremy killed Tim. (from 1-3 Notice that this standard form argument has more premises than my first reconstruction of the standard form argument (which consisted of only three statements). I have taken quite a few liberties in interpreting and paraphrasing this argument, but what I have tried to do is to get down to the most essential logic of the original argument. The paraphrases of the premises I have used are quite different from the wording that occurs in the original paragraph. I have introduced phrases such as \u201cit is possible that\u201d as well as conditional statements (if\u2026then statements), such as premise 3. Nonetheless, this reconstruction seems to get at the essence of the logic of the original argument. As long as your paraphrases help you to do that, they are good paraphrases.",
