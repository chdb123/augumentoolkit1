    "How does modus ponens relate to modus tollens in this proof?",
    "Modus ponens is used in line 3, which asserts that if the first premise (R v Sand the second premise (~T) are true, then we can infer the conclusion T. Modus tollens is used in line 4, which asserts that if we have the negated consequent (~T) and the second premise (R v S), we can infer the negated antecedent (F). Both rules help derive the conclusion from the given premises.",
    "This is so even though the consequent of the conditional is itself complex (i.e., it is a disjunction). That doesn\u2019t matter. The first premise is still a conditional statement (since the horseshoe is the main operatorand the second premise is the negated consequent of that conditional statement. The rule modus tollens says that if we have that much, we are entitled to infer the negated antecedent of the conditional. Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  99  We can use modus tollens to complete the proof we started above:  1. (R v S) \u2283 (T \u2283 K) 2. ~K 3. R v S /\u2234 ~T 4. T \u2283 K Modus ponens, lines 1, 3 5. ~T  Modus tollens, lines 2, 4  Notice that the last line of the proof is the conclusion that we are supposed to derive and that each statement that I have derived (i.e., lines 4 and 5) has a rule to the right. That rule cited is the rule that justifies the statement that is being derived and the lines cited are the previous lines of the proof where we can see that the rule applies. This is what is called a proof.",
