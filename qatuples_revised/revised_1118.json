    "Why do smaller populations tend to have more extreme results?",
    "Smaller populations will tend to have more extreme results because they are more likely to deviate from the average, as in the case of drawing marbles (either all white or all redor cancer rates being higher or lower than the national average.",
    "Can you see how this might apply to the case of kidney cancer rates in rural, sparsely populated counties? There is a national kidney cancer rate which is an average of all the kidney cancer rates of the 3,141 counties in the U.S. Imagine ranking each county in terms of the cancer rates from highest to lowest. The finding is that there is a relatively larger proportion of the sparsely populated counties at the top of this list, but also a relatively larger proportion of the sparsely populated counties at the bottom of the list. But why would it be that the more sparsely populated counties would be overrepresented at both ends of the list? The reason is that these counties have smaller populations, so they will tend to have more extreme results (of either the higher or lower rates). Just as Jack is more likely to get either all white marbles or all red marbles (an extreme result), the less populated counties will tend to have cancer rates that are at the extreme, relative to the national average. And this is a purely statistical fact; it has nothing to do with features of those environments causing the cancer rate to be higher or lower. Just as Jack\u2019s extreme draws have nothing to do with the way he is drawing (but are simply the result of statistical, mathematical facts), the extremes of the smaller counties have nothing to do with features of those counties, but only with the fact that they are smaller and so will tend to have more extreme results (i.e., cancer rates that are either higher or lower than the national average).",
