    "What convention does the author introduce for situations where a premise says nothing about a particular category?",
    "The convention states that when we encounter a situation where we must represent a particular on our three-category Venn, but the premise says nothing about a particular category, then we must put an asterisk on the line of that category.",
    "That convention says that when we encounter a situation where we must represent a particular on our three category Venn, but the premise says nothing about a particular category, then we must put the asterisk on the line of that category as I have done below. When we do this, it will represent that the particular is neither inside the category or outside the category. Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  136   We must do this same thing for the second premise, since we encounter the same problem there. Thus, when putting the asterisk in the intersection of the \u201ctwo-legged creatures\u201d and \u201cmammals\u201d categories, we cannot put the asterisk either inside or outside the \u201cbears\u201d category. Instead, we must put the asterisk on the line of the \u201cbears\u201d category. Thus, using this convention, we can represent the premise Venn and conclusion Venn as follows:    Keeping in mind the convention we have just introduced, we can see that this argument fails the Venn test of validity and is thus invalid. The reason is that the conclusion Venn clearly represents an individual in the intersection of the \u201ctwo- legged creatures\u201d and \u201cbears\u201d categories, whereas the premise Venn contains Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  137 no such information. Thus, the conclusion Venn contains information that is not contained in the premise Venn, which means the argument is invalid. We will close this section with one last example that will illustrate an important strategy.",
