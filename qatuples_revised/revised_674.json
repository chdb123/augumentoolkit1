    "What is the purpose of simplification in a logical argument?",
    "Simplification removes unnecessary or redundant information, making the argument more clear and easier to understand. It also helps identify which rule(scan be applied.",
    "The next question we ask when utilizing the strategy of working forward is: what lines of Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  109 the proof we can apply some rule to in order to derive something or other? Look at the conditional on line 2. We haven\u2019t used that yet. So what rule can we apply to that line? You should be thinking of the rules that utilize conditional statements (modus ponens, modus tollens, and hypothetical syllogism). We can rule out hypothetical syllogism since here we have only one conditional and the rule hypothetical syllogism requires that we have two. If you look at line 4 (that we have just derivedyou should see that it is the antecedent of the conditional statement on line 2. And you should know that that means we can apply the rule, modus ponens. So our next step is to do that:  1. A \u22c5 B 2. B \u2283 C /\u2234 C 3. A  Simplification 1 4. B  Simplification 1 5. C  Modus ponens 2, 4  But now also notice that the line that we have just derived is in fact the conclusion of the argument. So our proof is finished. Before the close of this section, let\u2019s work through a bit longer proof. Remember: any proof, long or short, is the same process and utilizes the same strategy.",
