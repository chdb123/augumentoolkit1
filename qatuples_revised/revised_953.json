    "What are some ways to determine if two situations are truly analogous?",
    "Two situations can be determined as analogous if they share relevant similarities in all aspects that affect the conclusion being drawn.",
    "The argument then proceeds by claiming that since we judge what Bob did to be morally wrong, and since our situation is analogous to Bob\u2019s in relevant respects (i.e., choosing to have luxury items for ourselves rather than saving the lives of dying children), then our actions of purchasing luxury items for ourselves must be morally wrong for the same reason. One way of arguing against the conclusion of this argument is by trying to argue that there are relevant disanalogies between Bob\u2019s situation and our own. For example, one might claim that in Bob\u2019s situation, there was something much more immediate he could do to save the child\u2019s life right then and there. In contrast, our own situation is not one in which a child that is physically proximate to us is in imminent danger of death, where there is something we can immediately do about it. One might argue that this disanalogy is enough to show that the two situations are not analogous and that, therefore, the conclusion does not follow. Whether or not this response to the argument is adequate, we can see that the way of objecting to an argument from analogy is by trying to show that there are relevant differences between the two things being compared in the analogy. For example, to return to my car example, even if the new car was a Subaru and was made under the same conditions as all of my other Subarus, if I purchased the current Subaru used, whereas all the other Subarus had been purchased new, then that could be a relevant difference that would weaken the conclusion that this Subaru will be reliable.",
