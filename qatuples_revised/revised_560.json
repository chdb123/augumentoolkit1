    "What is material equivalence in logic and how does it relate to truth tables?",
    "Material equivalence occurs when two symbolic sentences have the same truth value for every assignment of truth values to atomic propositions, as demonstrated by a truth table.",
    "Thus, the correct translation of this sentence is:   ~S \u2283 R Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  91  One simple trick you can use to translate sentences which use the term \u201cunless\u201d is just substitute the phrase \u201cif it\u2019s not the case that\u201d for the \u201cunless.\u201d But another trick is just to substitute an \u201cor\u201d for the \u201cunless.\u201d Although it may sound strange in English, a disjunction will always capture the truth functional meaning of \u201cunless.\u201d Thus, we could also correctly translate the sentence like this:   S v R  In the next section we will show how we can prove that these two sentences are equivalent using a truth table. 2.9 Material equivalence  As we saw in the last section, two different symbolic sentences can translate the same English sentence. In the last section I claimed that \u201c~S \u2283 R\u201d and \u201cS v R\u201d are equivalent. More precisely, they are equivalent ways of capturing the truth- functional relationship between propositions. Two propositions are materially equivalent if and only if they have the same truth value for every assignment of truth values to the atomic propositions. That is, they have the same truth values on every row of a truth table. The truth table below demonstrates that \u201c~S \u2283 R\u201d and \u201cS v R\u201d are materially equivalent.",
