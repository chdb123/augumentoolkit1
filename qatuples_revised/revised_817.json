All P is M  All M is S  \u2234 All S is P   3. All M is P  Some M is S  \u2234 Some S is P  4. All P is M  Some M is S  \u2234 Some S is P Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  139   5. All P is M  Some S is M  \u2234 Some S is P  6. All P is M  Some S is not M  \u2234 Some S is not P  7. All M is P  Some S is not M  \u2234 Some S is not P  8.
