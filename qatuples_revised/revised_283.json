    "The reasons he gives for how we know that Assad used chemical weapons include:   \u2022 images of the destruction of women and children (paragraph VI\u2022 humanitarian organizations\u2019 stories of hospitals full of civilians suffering from symptoms of exposure to chemical weapons (paragraph VI) \u2022 knowledge that Assad\u2019s chemical weapons experts were at a site where sarin gas is mixed just a few days before the attack (paragraph VII) \u2022 the fact that Assad distributed gas masks to his troops (paragraph VII) \u2022 the fact that Assad\u2019s forces fired rockets into neighborhoods where there were opposition forces (paragraph VII) \u2022 senior military officers in Assad\u2019s regime reviewed results of the attack (paragraph VIII) \u2022 the fact that sarin was found in blood and hair samples from people at the site of the attack (paragraph VIII)  These premises do indeed provide support for the conclusion that Assad used chemical weapons on civilians, but it is probably best to see this argument as a strong inductive argument, rather than a deductive argument. The evidence strongly supports, but does not compel, the conclusion that Assad was responsible. For example, even if all these facts were true, it could be that some other entity was trying to set Assad up. Thus, this first subargument should be taken as a strong inductive argument (assuming the premises are true, of course), since the truth of the premises would increase the probability that the conclusion is true, but not make the conclusion absolutely certain.",
