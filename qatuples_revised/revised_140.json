    "Can you provide another example of an argument that is valid, using the informal test for validity?",
    "Sure, here's an example: 1. All humans need oxygen to breathe. 2. Dogs are animals. 3. Dogs breathe. Therefore, all animals need oxygen (from 1-3). The premises are true and the conclusion is also true, so it's a valid argument.",
    "But that doesn\u2019t matter because all we want to know is whether it is possible that she doesn\u2019t. And if it is possible, what we have shown is that the Chapter 1: Reconstructing and analyzing arguments  21 conclusion does not logically follow from the premise alone. That is, the conclusion doesn\u2019t have to be true, even if we grant that the premise is. And that means that the argument is not valid (i.e., it is invalid). Let\u2019s switch examples and consider a different argument. 1. A person can be President of the United States only if they were born in the United States. 2. Obama is President of the United States. 3. Kenya is not in the United States. 4. Therefore, Obama was not born in Kenya (from 1-3 In order to apply the informal test of validity, we have to ask whether we can imagine a scenario in which the premises are both true and yet the conclusion is false. So, we have to imagine a scenario in which premises 1, 2, and 3 are true and yet the conclusion (\u201cObama was not born in Kenya\u201d) is false. Can you imagine such a scenario? You cannot. The reason is that if you are imagining that it is a) true that a person can be President of the United States only if they were born in the United States, b) true that Obama is president and c) true that Kenya is not in the U.S., then it must be true that Obama was not born in Kenya.",
