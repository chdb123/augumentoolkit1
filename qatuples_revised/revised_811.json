    "What is the purpose of Venn diagrams in determining the validity of a syllogism?",
    "Venn diagrams help visualize and understand the relationships between categories in a syllogism, making it easier to determine if the argument is valid or invalid. They show which statements are true, false, or unknown for each category.",
    "The strategy is that we should always map universal statements before mapping particular statements. Here is a categorical syllogism that illustrates this point. This time I am going to switch to just using the capital letters S, P, and M to represent the categories. Recall that we can do this because the Venn test of validity is a formal evaluation method where we don\u2019t have to actually understand what the categories represent in the world in order to determine whether the argument is valid. 1. Some S are M 2. All M are P 3.",
