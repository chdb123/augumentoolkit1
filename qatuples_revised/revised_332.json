    "What are truth functional connectives in propositional logic?",
    "Truth functional connectives are logical operators (such as 'and', 'or', and 'not'that determine the truth value of a compound proposition based on the truth values of its parts. They include conjunction, disjunction, negation, and conditional statements.",
    "(from 1 Regardless of whether you know what the statements in the first premise mean, we can still see that the inference is valid because the inference has the same form that I just pointed out above. Thus, you may not know what \u201cKant\u201d is (one of the most famous German philosophers of the Enlightenment) or what a \u201cdeontologist\u201d or \u201cPietist\u201d is, but you can still see that since these are statements that form a conjunction, and since the inference made has a particular form that is valid, this particular inference is valid. That is what it means for an argument to be valid in virtue of its form. In the next section we will delve into formal logic, which will involve learning a certain kind of language. Don\u2019t worry: it won\u2019t be as hard as your French or Spanish class. 2.2 Propositional logic and the four basic truth functional connectives  Propositional logic (also called \u201csentential logic\u201d) is the area of formal logic that deals with the logical relationships between propositions. A proposition is simply what I called in section 1.1 a statement.1 Some examples of propositions are:  Snow is white  Snow is cold  Tom is an astronaut  The floor has been mopped  The dishes have been washed                               1 Some philosophers would claim that a proposition is not the same as a statement, but the reasons for doing so are not relevant to what we\u2019ll be doing in this chapter.",
