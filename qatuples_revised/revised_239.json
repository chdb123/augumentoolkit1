    "What is the difference between 'rebel' and 'freedom fighter' in terms of evaluation?",
    "'Rebel' makes a negative evaluation, while 'freedom fighter' makes a positive evaluation.",
    "The difference is that whereas \u201crebel\u201d makes a negative evaluation, \u201cfreedom fighter\u201d makes a positive evaluation. Table 3 below gives a small sampling of some evaluative terms. beautiful dangerous wasteful sneaky cute murder prudent courageous timid nosy sloppy smart capable insane curt  English contains an interesting mechanism for turning positively evaluative terms into negative evaluative ones. All you have to do is put the word \u201ctoo\u201d before a positively evaluative terms and it will all of a sudden take on a negative connotation. Compare the following:  John is honest. John is too honest. Chapter 1: Reconstructing and analyzing arguments  38 Whereas \u201chonest\u201d is a positively evaluative term, \u201ctoo honest\u201d is a negatively evaluative term. When someone describes John as \u201ctoo honest,\u201d we can easily imagine that person going on to describe how John\u2019s honesty is actually a liability or negative trait. Not so when he is simply described as honest. Since the word \u201ctoo\u201d indicates an excess, and to say that something is an excess is to make a criticism, we can see why the word \u201ctoo\u201d changes the valence of an evaluation from positive to negative. Evaluative language provides a good illustration of the difference between logic, which is concerned with the analysis and evaluation of arguments, and rhetoric, which is concerned with persuasion more generally.",
