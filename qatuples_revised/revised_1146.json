    "What is the main difference between formal and informal fallacies?",
    "Formal fallacies are structural errors in reasoning, while informal fallacies involve language or contextual misuse.",
    "Two formal fallacies that are similar to, but should never be confused with, modus ponens and modus tollens are denying the antecedent and affirming the consequent. Here are the forms of those invalid inferences:   Denying the antecedent  p \u2283 q  ~p  \u2234 ~q   Affirming the consequent  p \u2283 q  q  \u2234 p  Any argument that has either of these forms is an invalid argument. For example:  1. If Kant was a deontologist, then he was a non-consequentialist. 2. Kant was not a deontologist. 3. Therefore, Kant was a not a non-consequentialist. The form of this argument is:  1. D \u2283 C 2. ~D 3. \u2234 ~C  Chapter 4: Informal fallacies  188 As you can see, this argument has the form of the fallacy, denying the antecedent. Thus, we know that this argument is invalid even if we don\u2019t know what \u201cKant\u201d or \u201cdeontologist\u201d or \u201cnon-consequentialist\u201d means. (\u201cKant\u201d was a famous German philosopher from the early 1800s, whereas \u201cdeontology\u201d and \u201cnon-consequentialist\u201d are terms that come from ethical theory.)",
