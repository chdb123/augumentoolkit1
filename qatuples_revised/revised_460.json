    "How does a 'neither nor' statement compare to a negation of a disjunction?",
    "A \"neither nor\" statement is equivalent to a negation of a disjunction.",
    "Thus, the correct translation of a \u201cneither nor\u201d statement is as a conjunction of two negations:   ~C \u22c5 ~I  The main operator of this statement is the dot, which is conjoining the ~C with the ~I. Thus, the form of any \u201cneither nor\u201d statement can always be translated as a conjunction of two negations:   ~p \u22c5 ~q  As we will see in a later section (where we will prove it), this statement is also equivalent to a negation of a disjunction:   ~(p v q Thus, the English locution \u201cneither nor\u201d can also be translated using this statement form. Exercise 11: For each of the following, write out what atomic proposition each constant stands for. Then translate the sentences using the constants you have defined. Finally, after you have translated the sentence, identify which truth-functional connective is the main operator of the sentence. 1. Coral is not both a plant and an animal. (P, A) ~C ~I True Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  76 2. Although protozoa and chimpanzees are both eukaryotes, they are not both animals. (There are four atomic propositions here; just use A, B, C, and D for each different proposition.) 3. Neither chimpanzees nor protozoa are prokaryotes. (C, P) 4.",
