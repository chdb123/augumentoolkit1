    "How does the conclusion of the proof relate to the premises, using the conjunction rule?",
    "The conclusion is a conjunction of both premises (T v L and R \u22c5 S), which are derived from separate lines using the conjunction rule. This means that if T is true and L are true, and R \u22c5 S is also true, then the overall conclusion is true.",
    "Since we have \u201cT\u201d as the second premise, the rule addition allows us to disjoin \u201cL\u201d to that statement. The first new line of the proof should thus look like this:  3. T v L Addition 2  What I have done is number a new line of the proof (continuing the numbering from the premisesand then have written the rule that justifies that new line as well as the line(s) from which that line was derived via that rule. In this case, since addition is a rule that allows you to derive a sentence directly from just one line, I have cited only one line. The next step of the proof should be clear since we have already talked through it above. All we have to do now is go directly to the conclusion, since the conclusion is a conjunction and we now have (on separate lines of the proof) each conjunct. Thus, the final line of this (quite simple) proof should look like this:  4. (T v L) \u22c5 (R \u22c5 S) Conjunction 1, 3  Again, all I\u2019ve done is the write the new line of the proof (continuing the numbering from the previous line) and then have written the rule that justifies that new line as well as the line(s) from which that line was derived via that rule. In this case, the rule conjunction requires that we cite two lines (i.e., each conjunct that we are conjoining).",
