    "What is the difference between an argument and a subargument?",
    "An argument consists of one or more premises that support a conclusion, while a subargument is a part of the main argument that has its own premises and conclusion. In this case, statement 2 (Cyclists often roll up their right pant legand statement 1 (Wanda arrived at work with her right pant leg rolled up) form a subargument that supports the main conclusion (Wanda rode her bike to work today).",
    "Moreover, our coworker, Bob, who works in accounting, saw her riding towards work at 7:45 am. The conclusion of this argument is \u201cWanda rode her bike to work today\u201d and there are two premises that provide independent support for it: the fact that Wanda had her pant leg cuffed and the fact that Bob saw her riding her bike. Here is the argument in standard form:  1. Wanda arrived at work with her right pant leg rolled up. 2. Cyclists often roll up their right pant leg. 3. Bob saw Wanda riding her bike towards work at 7:45. 4. Therefore, Wanda rode her bike to work today. (from 1-2, 3 independently Again, notice that next to statement 4 of the argument I have written the premises from which that conclusion follows. In this case, in order to avoid any ambiguity, I have noted that the support for the conclusion comes independently from statements 1 and 2, on the one hand, and from statement 3, on the other hand. It is important to point out that an argument or subargument can be supported by one or more premises. We see this in the present argument since the conclusion (4) is supported jointly by 1 and 2, and singly by 3. As before, we can represent the structure of this argument spatially, as figure 2 shows:    There are endless different argument structures that can be generated from these few simple patterns.",
