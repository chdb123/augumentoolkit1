    "Why are basic forms of inference important in logical arguments?",
    "Basic forms of inference are important because they are simple and their validity is transparent. They function as rules that justify non-obvious inferences made in an argument.",
    "Being able to recognize the forms of these inferences is an important skill that you will have to become proficient at in order to do proofs. The next four forms of inference we will introduce utilize conjunction, disjunction and negation in different ways. We will start with the rule called \u201csimplification,\u201d which has the following form:  1. p \u22c5 q 2. \u2234 p  What this rule says, in words, is that if we have asserted a conjunction then we are entitled to infer either one of the conjuncts. This is the rule that I introduced in the first section of this chapter. It is a pretty \u201cobvious\u201d rule\u2014so obvious, in fact, that we might even wonder why we have to state it. However, every form of inference that we will introduce in this section should be obvious\u2014that is the point of calling them basic forms of inference. They are some of the simplest forms of inference, whose validity should be transparently obvious. The idea of a proof is that although the inference being made in the argument is not obvious, we can break that inference down in steps, each of which is obvious. Thus, the obvious inferences ultimately justify the non-obvious inference being made in the argument. Those obvious inferences thus function as rules that we use to justify each step of the proof. Simplification is a prime example of one of the more obvious rules. Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  101 As before, it is important to realize that any inference that has the same form as simplification is a valid inference.",
