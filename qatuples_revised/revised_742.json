    "How do categorical sentences relate to Venn diagrams?",
    "Categorical sentences use the form \"some S are P\" and can be represented visually using Venn diagrams to show relationships between categories (S and P).",
    "Here is how we\u2019d translate this sentence using our two categories:   Some birds are things that are taller than President Obama. Again, although this sentence sounds strange in English, it has the same form as the categorical form, some S are P, and it allows us to clearly see what the two categories are. Below is the Venn diagram for this statement:     Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  121    By convention, an asterisk on the Venn diagram means that there is at least one thing in that category. By putting the asterisk in the intersection of the two categories, we are saying that there is at least one thing that is a bird and is taller than President Obama, which is exactly what our original sentence was saying. Finally, let\u2019s consider the statement, \u201csome birds don\u2019t fly.\u201d How would we translate this sentence to have the \u201csome S are not P\u201d form? The first step is to get the descriptions of the two categories using either nouns or noun phrases. The \u201cS\u201d term is easy; it is just \u201cbirds\u201d again. But we have to be a bit more careful with the \u201cP\u201d term, since its predicate contains a negation. We do not want any of our categories to contain a negation. Rather, the negation is contained in the form (i.e., the \u201cnot\u201d). The category cannot be simply \u201cfly\u201d or even \u201cflies\u201d since neither of these are a category of thing.",
