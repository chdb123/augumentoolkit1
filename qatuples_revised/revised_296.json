    "Therefore, if we don\u2019t respond to Assad\u2019s use of chemical weapons, U.S. troops will be more likely to face chemical weapons on the battlefield. (from 1-4 Premise 5 is an intermediate conclusion that makes explicit what follows from premises 1-4 (which I have represented using parentheses after that intermediate conclusion). We can do the same thing with the inference that follows from premises, 1, 7, and 8 (i.e., line 9). If we add in our missing premises then we have a reconstructed argument for what I earlier called the \u201cintermediate conclusion\u201d (i.e., the one that Obama most directly argues for):  1. If we don\u2019t respond to Assad\u2019s use of chemical weapons, then Assad\u2019s regime will continue using them with impunity. 2. If Assad\u2019s regime uses chemical weapons with impunity, this will effectively erode the ban on them. Chapter 1: Reconstructing and analyzing arguments  46 3. If the ban on chemical weapons erodes, then other tyrants will be more likely to attain and use them. 4. If other tyrants attain and use chemical weapons, U.S. troops will be more likely to face chemical weapons on the battlefield. 5.
