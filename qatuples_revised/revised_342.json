    "How does negation affect the truth of a conjunction?",
    "Negating one or both conjuncts in a conjunction will result in a false conjunction, as negation is an inverted truth-value. If p \u22c5 q is true and we negate p, it becomes \u00acp \u22c5 q, which is false; if we negate q, it becomes p \u22c5 \u00acq, also false.",
    "In any case, we can see that \u201cit is sunny today\u201d is the proposition in the \u201cp\u201d place of the form of the conjunction, whereas \u201cit is hot today\u201d is the proposition in the \u201cq\u201d place of the form of the conjunction. As before, this conjunction is true only if both conjuncts are true. For example, suppose that it is a sunny but bitterly cold winter\u2019s day. In that case, while it is true that it is sunny today, it is false that it is hot today\u2014in which case the conjunction is false. If someone were to assert that it is sunny and hot today in those circumstances, you would tell them that isn\u2019t true. Conversely, if it were a cloudy but hot and humid summer\u2019s day, the conjunction would still be false. The only way the statement would be true is if both conjuncts were true. In the formal language that we are developing in this chapter, we will represent conjunctions using a symbol called the \u201cdot,\u201d which looks like this: \u201c\u22c5\u201d Using this symbol, here is how we will represent a conjunction in symbolic notation:  p \u22c5 q  In the following sections we will introduce four basic truth-functional connectives, each of which have their own symbol and meaning. The four basic truth-functional connectives are: conjunction, disjunction, negation, and conditional. In the remainder of this section, we will discuss only conjunction. As we\u2019ve seen, a conjunction conjoins two separate propositions to form a complex proposition.",
