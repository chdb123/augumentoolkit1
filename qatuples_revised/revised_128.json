    "What is the informal test of validity in logic and critical thinking?",
    "The informal test of validity involves asking if you can imagine a world where all premises are true but the conclusion is false. If you can, the argument is invalid; if not, it's valid. It doesn't matter whether the premises (or conclusionare actually true or not.",
    "Gerald Ford was President of the United States but he was never elected president, since Ford Replaced Richard Nixon when Nixon resigned in the wake of the Watergate scandal.2 So it doesn\u2019t follow that just because someone is President of the United States that they were elected President of the United States. In other words, it is possible for the premise of the argument to be true and yet the conclusion false. And this means that the argument is invalid. If an argument is invalid it will always be possible to construct a counterexample to show that it is invalid (as I have done with the Gerald Ford scenario). A counterexample is simply a description of a scenario in which the premises of the argument are all true while the conclusion of the argument is false. If you can construct a counterexample to an argument, the argument is invalid. In order to determine whether an argument is valid or invalid we can use what I\u2019ll call the informal test of validity. To apply the informal test of validity ask yourself whether you can imagine a world in which all the premises are true and yet the conclusion is false. If you can imagine such a world, then the argument is invalid. If you cannot imagine such a world, then the argument is valid. Notice: it is possible to imagine a world where the premises are true even if the premises aren\u2019t, as a matter of actual fact, true. This is why it doesn\u2019t matter for validity whether the premises (or conclusionof the argument are actually true.",
