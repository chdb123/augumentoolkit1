    "What is the small numbers fallacy?",
    "The small numbers fallacy occurs when one assumes that a correlation found in a small sample size must have a causal explanation, even if it could be due to chance or other factors not considered. In the case of kidney cancer and rural counties, it would lead people to assume there's something special about rural environments causing lower incidence.",
    "So the chances that Nancy really is a robber, given Bob\u2019s eyewitness evidence is:                               8 This example is taken (with certain alterationsfrom: http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/8153539.stm Chapter 3: Evaluating inductive arguments and probabilistic and statistical fallacies  182 # ', \"'00$\"( 1'0 2'\"\"$2!.3 )4$5! ),)$( !

Thus, it is more likely that Nancy is not the robber. 3.8 The small numbers fallacy  Suppose a study showed that of the 3,141 counties of the United States, the incidence of kidney cancer was lowest in those counties which are mostly rural, sparsely populated, and located in traditionally Republican states. In fact, this is true.9 What accounts for this interesting finding? Most people would be tempted to look for a causal explanation\u2014to look for features of the rural environment that account for the lower incidence of cancer. However, they would be wrong (in this case) to do so.",
