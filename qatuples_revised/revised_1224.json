    "What is the final probability in the given chain of conditions?",
    "The probability of having a grandson with a dog collar is only 27%.",
    "If you use cable, then your cable will probably go on the fritz (.9If your cable is on the fritz, then you will probably get angry (.9) If you get angry, then you will probably hit the table (.9) If you hit the table, your daughter will probably imitate you (.8) Chapter 4: Informal fallacies  200 If your daughter imitates you, she will probably be kicked out of school (.8) If she is kicked out of school, she will probably meet undesirables (.9) If she meets undesirables, she will probably marry undesirables (.8) If she marries undesirables, you will probably have a grandson with a dog collar (.8)  However, even if we grant the probabilities of each link in the chain is high (80- 90% probable), the conclusion doesn\u2019t even reach a probability higher than chance. Recall that in order to figure the probability of a conjunction, we must multiply the probability of each conjunct:   (.9) \u00d7 (.9) \u00d7 (.9) \u00d7 (.8) \u00d7 (.8) \u00d7 (.9) \u00d7 (.8) \u00d7 (.8) = .27  That means the probability of the conclusion (i.e., that if you use cable, you will have a grandson with a dog collar) is only 27%, despite the fact that each conditional has a relatively high probability!",
