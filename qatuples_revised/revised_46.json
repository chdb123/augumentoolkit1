    "What is wrong with these sentences as arguments: 'I have been running competitively since 1999. I am so happy to have finally finished that class'?",
    "These sentences do not contain indicators for premises or conclusions, and therefore are not arguments. They express unrelated thoughts or emotions without logical connections. The presence of \"so\" does not make them an argument in this case.",
    "Chapter 1: Reconstructing and analyzing arguments  5  In this example, the word \u201ctherefore\u201d is a conclusion indicator because what follows it is a statement that someone is trying to establish as true (i.e., a conclusion). As before, in both of these cases the conclusion indicators \u201cso\u201d and \u201ctherefore\u201d are interchangeable: I could have used \u201cso\u201d in place of \u201ctherefore\u201d or \u201ctherefore\u201d in the place of \u201cso\u201d and the meaning of the sentences would have been the same. Table 1 contains a list of some common premise and conclusion indicators:  Premise indicators Conclusion indicators since therefore because so for hence as thus given that implies that seeing that consequently for the reason that it follows that is shown by the fact that we may conclude that  Although these words and phrases can be used to identify the premises and conclusions of arguments, they are not failsafe methods of doing so. Just because a sentence contains them does not mean that you are dealing with an argument. This can easily be shown by examples like these:  I have been running competitively since 1999. I am so happy to have finally finished that class. Although \u201csince\u201d can function as a premise indicator and although \u201cso\u201d can function as a conclusion indicator, neither one is doing so here.",
