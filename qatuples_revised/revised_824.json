    "What is an inductive argument in 'Introduction to Logic and Critical Thinking' by Matthew Van Cleave?",
    "An inductive argument is an argument whose conclusion follows from its premises with a high level of probability, rather than certainty. It can be made stronger or weaker by adding further premises.",
    "Some P is M  Some S is not M  \u2234 Some S is P   Chapter 3: Evaluating inductive arguments and probabilistic and statistical fallacies  140 3.1 Inductive arguments and statistical generalizations  As we saw in chapter 1 (section 1.8), an inductive argument is an argument whose conclusion is supposed to follow from its premises with a high level of probability, rather than with certainty. This means that although it is possible that the conclusion doesn\u2019t follow from its premises, it is unlikely that this is the case. We said that inductive arguments are \u201cdefeasible,\u201d meaning that we could turn a strong inductive argument into a weak inductive argument simply by adding further premises to the argument. In contrast, deductive arguments that are valid can never be made invalid by adding further premises. Recall our \u201cTweets\u201d argument:  1. Tweets is a healthy, normally functioning bird 2. Most healthy, normally functioning birds fly 3. Therefore, Tweets probably flies  Without knowing anything else about Tweets, it is a good bet that Tweets flies. However, if we were to add that Tweets is 6 ft. tall and can run 30 mph, then it is no longer a good bet that Tweets can fly (since in this case Tweets is likely an ostrich and therefore can\u2019t fly). The second premise, \u201cmost healthy, normally functioning birds fly,\u201d is a statistical generalization.",
