    "What are the two conditions required for a statistical generalization to be deemed 'good'?",
    "The two conditions are adequate sample size and non-biased sample.",
    "Therefore, candidate X will probably win the election  This is an inductive argument because even if the premise is true, the conclusion could still be false (for example, an opponent of candidate X could systematically kill or intimidate those voters who intend to vote for candidate X so that very few of them will actually vote). Furthermore, it is clear that the argument is intended to be inductive because the conclusion contains the word \u201cprobably,\u201d which clearly indicates that an inductive, rather than deductive, inference is intended. Remember that in evaluating arguments we want to know about the strength of the inference from the premises to the conclusion, but we also want to know whether the premise is true! We can assess whether or not a statistical generalization is true by considering whether the statistical generalization meets certain conditions. There are two conditions that any statistical generalization must meet in order for the generalization to be deemed \u201cgood.\u201d   1. Adequate sample size: the sample size must be large enough to support the generalization. 2. Non-biased sample: the sample must not be biased. A sample is simply a portion of a population. A population is the totality of members of some specified set of objects or events. For example, if I were determining the relative proportion of cars to trucks that drive down my street on a given day, the population would be the total number of cars and trucks that drive down my street on a given day.",
