    "What are some limitations of propositional logic?",
    "Some valid arguments, like \"If all humans are mortal and all mortal things die, then all humans die,\" cannot be shown as valid using propositional logic. It requires categorical logic to capture these wider inferences.",

The premises are both true on that row and yet the conclusion is false. That means that this argument does not pass the truth table test of validity and so is invalid. But clearly this argument is valid. If it is true that all humans are mortal and that all mortal things die, then it must be true that all humans die. What this argument reveals is one of the limitations of propositional logic. There are some arguments that are intuitively valid (such as this onebut that cannot be shown to be valid using the methods of propositional logic. This shows that we need other kinds of formal logic to be able to capture a wider range of logically valid inferences. Categorical logic allows us to supplement propositional logic with a formal method that will handle arguments like this that propositional logic is unable to handle. Categorical logic is the logic that deals with the logical relationship between categorical statements. A categorical statement is simply a statement about a category or type of thing. For example, the first premise of the above argument is a statement about the categories of humans and things that are mortal.",
