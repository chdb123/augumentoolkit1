    "What is the higher incidence mentioned in the argument?",
    "The higher incidence of psychological problems in children of gay couples.",
    "The rate of psychological problems in children of gay couples is higher than in children of heterosexual couples. 3. The higher incidence of psychological problems in children of gay couples is not due to any kind of injustice in society, but to the fact that the parents are gay. 4. The state should always do what it can to decrease harm to children. 5. Therefore, the state should discourage gay couples from raising children. (from 1-4 In this argument, premises 2-4 are the missing or assumed premises. Their addition makes the argument much stronger, but making them explicit enables us to clearly see what assumptions the argument relies on in order for the argument to be valid. This is useful since we can now clearly see which premises of the argument we may challenge as false. Arguably, premise 4 is false, since the state shouldn\u2019t always do what it can to decrease harm to children. Rather, it should only do so as long as such an action didn\u2019t violate other rights that the state has to protect or create larger harms elsewhere. The important lesson from this example is that supplying the missing premises of an argument is not always a simple matter. In the example above, I have used the principle of charity to supply missing premises. Mastering this skill is truly an art (rather than a science) since there is never just one correct way of doing it (cf. section 1.5) and because it requires a lot of skilled practice.",
