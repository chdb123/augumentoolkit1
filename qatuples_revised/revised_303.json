    "How do Missing Premise 2 and Missing Premise 3 contribute to the conclusion in Obama's argument about responding to Assad?",
    "These premises imply that military force is the only viable option for addressing Assad's threats, and that not responding at all would be detrimental to national security. Without these premises, Obama's argument may be flawed or incomplete.",
    "Consider: even if it is true that we should respond to a threat to our national security, it doesn\u2019t follow that we should respond with military force. For example, maybe we could respond with certain kinds of economic sanctions that would force the country to submit to our will. Furthermore, maybe there are some security threats such that responding to them with military force would only create further, and worse, security threats. Presumably we wouldn\u2019t want our response to a security threat to create even bigger security threats. For these reasons, we can see that Obama\u2019s argument, if it is to be valid, also relies on missing premises such as these:  Chapter 1: Reconstructing and analyzing arguments  47 Missing premise 2: The only way that the United States can adequately respond to the security threat that Assad poses is by military force. Missing premise 3: It is in the national security interests of the United States to respond adequately to any national security threat. These are big assumptions and they may very well turn out to be mistaken. Nevertheless, it is important to see that the main conclusion Obama argues for depends on these missing premises\u2014premises that he never explicitly states in his argument. So here is the final, reconstructed argument in standard form. I have italicized each missing premise or intermediate conclusion that I have added but that wasn\u2019t explicitly stated in Obama\u2019s argument. 1.",
