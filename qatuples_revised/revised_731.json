    "What are the four categorical forms in logic according to 'Introduction to Logic and Critical Thinking' by Matthew Van Cleave?",
    "The four categorical forms are All S are P, No S are P, Some S are P, and Some S are not P, and No S are not P.",
    "So the reason the category \u201cthings that are mortal\u201d is left unshaded is that in saying \u201call humans are mortal\u201d I leave open the possibility that there are things that are not human and yet mortal. As noted above, the statement, \u201call humans are mortal,\u201d has a particular form:  All H are M.   This is one of the four categorical forms. The way we will represent these categorical forms generally are with an \u201cS\u201d (which stands for \u201csubject term\u201dand a \u201cP\u201d (which stands for \u201cpredicate term\u201d). Thus, the categorical statement, \u201call humans are mortal,\u201d has the following categorical form:   All S are P  The way we interpret statements of this form are as follows: everything in the category S is also in the category P. This statement form is what we call a \u201cuniversal affirmative,\u201d since it is a universal statement that does not contain a negation. There are three other categorical statement forms that you will have to become familiar with in order to do categorical logic.",
