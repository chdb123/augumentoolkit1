    "How does the truth table for conjunction represent the relationship between p and q?",
    "The truth table shows all possible scenarios regarding the truth values of p and q, and how their conjunction (p \u22c5 qdepends on those values. If both are true, then the conjunction is true; if not, it's false.",
    "The conjunction is true if and only if both conjuncts are true. We can represent this information using what is called a truth table. Truth tables represent how the truth value of a complex proposition depends on the truth values of the propositions that compose it. Here is the truth table for conjunction:  p q p \u22c5 q T T T T F F F T F F F F  Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  55 Here is how to understand this truth table. The header row lists the atomic propositions, p and q, that the conjunction is composed of, as well as the conjunction itself, p \u22c5 q. Each of the following four rows represents a possible scenario regarding the truth of each conjunct, and there are only four possible scenarios: either p and q could both be true (as in row 1), p and q could both be false (as in row 4), p could be true while q is false (row 2), or p could be false while q is true (row 3). The final column (the truth values under the conjunction, p \u22c5 qrepresents how the truth value of the conjunction depends on the truth value of each conjunct (p and q). As we have seen, a conjunction is true if and only if both conjuncts are true. This is what the truth table represents.",
