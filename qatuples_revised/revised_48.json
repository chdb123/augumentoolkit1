    "Premise indicators connect two separate statements by establishing a relationship between them, showing that one statement supports or explains the other.",
    "This shows that you can\u2019t simply mindlessly use occurrences of these words in sentences to show that there is an argument being made. Rather, we have to rely on our understanding of the English sentence in order to determine whether an argument is being made or not. Thus, the best way to determine whether an argument is present is by asking the question: Is there a statement that someone is trying to establish as true or explain why it is true by basing it on some other statement? If so, then there is an argument present. If not, then there isn\u2019t. Notice that if we apply this method to the above examples, we will Chapter 1: Reconstructing and analyzing arguments  6 see that there is no argument present because there is no statement that someone is trying to establish as true by basing it on some other statement. For example, the sentence \u201cI have been running competitively since 1999\u201d just contains one statement, not two. But arguments always require at least two separate statements\u2014one premise and one conclusion, so it cannot possibly be an argument. Another way of explaining why these occurrences of \u201cso\u201d and \u201csince\u201d do not indicate that an argument is present is by noting that both premise indicators and conclusion indicators are, grammatically, conjunctions. A grammatical conjunction is a word that connects two separate statements. So, if a word or term is truly being used as a premise or conclusion indicator, it must connect two separate statements.",
