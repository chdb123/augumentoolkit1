    "The truth values for p, q, and ~(p v qremain unchanged when using the biconditional.",
    "p q ~p \u22c5 ~q ~(p v qT T      F  F  F      F  T T F      F  F  T      F  T F T      T  F  F      F  T F F      T  T  T      T  F  Again, as you can see from the truth table, the truth values under the main operators of each sentence are identical on every row (i.e., for every assignment of truth values to the atomic propositions). In fact, there is a fifth truth functional connective called \u201cmaterial equivalence\u201d or the \u201cbiconditional\u201d that is defined as true when the atomic propositions share the same truth value, and false when the truth values different. Although we will not be relying on the biconditional, I provide the truth table for it below.",
