This is another example of how bias can creep into a statistical generalization through a biased way of asking a question. Chapter 3: Evaluating inductive arguments and probabilistic and statistical fallacies  145 Random sampling is a common sampling method that attempts to avoid any kinds of sampling bias by making selection of individuals for the sample a matter of random chance (i.e., anyone in the population is as likely as anyone else to be chosen for the sample). The basic justification behind the method of random sampling is that if the sample is truly random (i.e., anyone in the population is as likely as anyone else to be chosen for the sample), then the sample will be representative. The trick for any random sampling technique is to find a way of selecting individuals for the sample that doesn\u2019t create any kind of bias. A common method used to select individuals for a random sample (for example, by Gallup pollsis to call people on either their landline or cell phones. Since most voting Americans have either a landline or a cell phone, this is a good way of ensuring that every American has an equal chance of being included in the sample. Next, a random number generating computer program selects numbers to dial.",
