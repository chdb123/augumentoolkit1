    "What does line 6 state in terms of 'A' and 'B'?",
    "Line 6 states \"~A v (B v ~B),\" which means \"Not A or not-not B.\" It is the negation of both A and the disjunction of A and not B. This implies that if A is true, then B must be false; if B is true, then A must be false.",
    "Look at lines 2 and 3. You should see a modus tollens there. That will be our next step:  8. ~A  Modus tollens 2, 3  The next step of this proof can be a bit tricky. There are a couple different ways we could go. One would be to utilize the rule \u201caddition.\u201d Can you see how we might helpfully utilize this rule using either line 6 or 8? If not, I\u2019ll give you a hint: what if we were to use addition on line 8 to derive \u201c~A v B\u201d? Can you see how we could then plug that into line 1? In fact, \u201c~A v B\u201d is the antecedent of the conditional in line 1, so we could then use modus ponens to derive the consequent. Thus, let\u2019s try starting with the addition on line 8:  9. ~A v B Addition 8  Next, we\u2019ll utilize line 9 and line 1 with modus ponens to derive the next line:  10. L  Modus ponens 1, 9  Notice at this point that what we have derived on line 10 is \u201cL\u201d and what we earlier said we needed as one of the conjuncts was \u201cL v G\u201d. You should recognize that we have a rule that will allow us to infer directly from \u201cL\u201d to \u201cL v G\u201d. That rule is addition (again).",
