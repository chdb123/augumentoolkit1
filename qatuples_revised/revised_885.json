    "What is the form of the inference to the best explanation?",
    "The form of the inference to the best explanation is: 1. Observed facts; 2. Explanation (hypothesis); 3. Comparison (of competing explanations); 4. Conclusion (the hypothesis is true).",
    "This explanation explains all the relevant facts in a simple way (i.e., it was the thief Chapter 3: Evaluating inductive arguments and probabilistic and statistical fallacies  148 responsible for both thingsand this kind of thing is (unfortunately) not uncommon\u2014it happens to other people at other times and places. The baseball-dog scenario is not as plausible because it doesn\u2019t happen in contexts like this one (i.e., in a parking garage) nearly as often and it is not as simple (i.e., we need to posit two different events that are unconnected to each other\u2014stray baseball, stray dog\u2014rather than just one\u2014the thief). Inference to the best explanation is a form of inductive argument whose premises are a set of observed facts, a hypothesis that explains those observed facts, and a comparison of competing explanations, and whose conclusion is that the hypothesis is true. The example we\u2019ve just been discussing is an inference to the best explanation. Here is its form:  1. Observed facts: Your car window is broken and your iPod is gone. 2. Explanation: The hypothesis that a thief broke the window and stole your iPod provides a reasonable explanation of the observed facts. 3. Comparison: No other hypothesis provides as reasonable an explanation. 4. Conclusion: Therefore, a thief broke your car window and stole your iPod.",
