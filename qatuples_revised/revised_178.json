    "What is the missing premise in the given argument 'Since children who are raised by gay couples often have psychological and emotional problems, the state should discourage gay couples from raising children' in Introduction to Logic and Critical Thinking by Matthew Van Cleave?",
    "The missing premise could be \"Gay couples raising children negatively affects society or children's well-being.\" This would make the argument more valid and plausible. However, without additional context, it is difficult to determine the most appropriate premise.",
    "As we can see from this example, a missing premise is a premise that the argument needs in order to be as strong as possible. Typically, this means supplying the statement(sthat are needed to make the argument valid. But in addition to making the argument valid, we want to make the argument plausible. This is called \u201cthe principle of charity.\u201d The principle of charity states that when reconstructing an argument, you should try to make that argument (whether inductive or deductive) as strong as possible. When it comes to supplying missing premises, this means supplying the most plausible premises needed in order to make the argument either valid (for deductive arguments) or inductively strong (for inductive arguments). Although in the last example figuring out the missing premise was relatively easy to do, it is not always so easy. Here is an argument whose missing premises are not as easy to determine:  Since children who are raised by gay couples often have psychological and emotional problems, the state should discourage gay couples from raising children. The conclusion of this argument, that the state should not allow gay marriage, is apparently supported by a single premise, which should be recognizable from the occurrence of the premise indicator, \u201csince.\u201d Thus, our initial reconstruction of the standard form argument looks like this:  1. Children who are raised by gay couples often have psychological and emotional problems. 2. Therefore, the state should discourage gay couples from raising children.",
