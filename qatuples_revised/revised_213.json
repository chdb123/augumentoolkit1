    "How can a speaker imply the strength of their beliefs without explicitly stating it?",
    "A speaker can imply the strength of their beliefs by using phrases like \"I'm certain that,\" \"I'm sure that,\" or \"I can assure you that.\" They may also mention how long they have held the belief, as in \"Over the years, I have become convinced that...\" or use hyperbole, such as \"I would bet a million dollars that...\" to emphasize their confidence. Another method is by implying that it would be unreasonable for someone to disagree with their claim, like stating \"every sensible person would agree with the claim.\"",
    "The rhetorical effect is that by commenting on how sure you are that something is true, you imply, without saying, that there must be very strong reasons for what you believe\u2014assuming that the audience believes you are a reasonable person, of course. Here are some ways of commenting on the strength of one\u2019s beliefs:  I\u2019m certain that\u2026  I\u2019m sure that\u2026  I can assure you that\u2026                              3 This characterization and discussion draws heavily on chapter 3, pp. 48-53 of Sinnott- Armstrong and Fogelin\u2019s Understanding Arguments, 9th edition (Cengage Learning). Chapter 1: Reconstructing and analyzing arguments  33  Over the years, I have become convinced that\u2026  I would bet a million dollars that\u2026  Yet another way of assuring one\u2019s audience is to make an audience member feel that it would be stupid, odd, or strange to deny the claim one is making. One common way to do this is by implying that every sensible person would agree with the claim.",
