    "How does introducing 'know' change the conclusion in the second paraphrase compared to the first one?",
    "The second paraphrase, \"We do not know that Jeremy killed Tim,\" is simpler and less specific than the first one, which states \"the fact that Jeremy's prints were on the gun that killed Tim and the gun was registered to Jeremy doesn't mean that Jeremy killed Tim.\"",
    "Someone could have stolen Jeremy\u2019s gun and then used it to kill Tim 3. Therefore, the fact that Jeremy\u2019s prints were on the gun that killed Tim and the gun was registered to Jeremy doesn\u2019t mean that Jeremy killed Tim. (from 1-2 However, as I have just noted, there is more than one way of paraphrasing the premises and conclusion of the argument. To illustrate this, I will give a second way that one could accurately capture this argument in standard form. Here is another way of expressing the conclusion:   We do not know that Jeremy killed Tim. That is clearly what the above argument is trying to ultimately establish and it is a much simpler (in some ways) conclusion than my first way of paraphrasing the conclusion. However, it also takes more liberties in interpreting the argument than my original paraphrase. For example, in the original argument there is no occurrence of the word \u201cknow.\u201d That is something that I am introducing in my own paraphrase. That is a totally legitimate thing to do, as long as introducing new terminology helps us to clearly express the essence of the premise or Chapter 1: Reconstructing and analyzing arguments  17 conclusion that we\u2019re trying to paraphrase.1 Since my second paraphrase of the conclusion differs from my first paraphrase, you can expect that my premises will differ also. So how shall I paraphrase the premises that support this conclusion?",
