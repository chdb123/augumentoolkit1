    "What does it mean for a condition to be 'trivially' sufficient?",
    "A condition is trivially sufficient when it is never absent in cases where the target is present.",
    "We have rigorously tested A as a necessary condition only if we have collected data in which A was not present. Otherwise, we don\u2019t really know whether A is a necessary condition. Similarly, B trivially passes the sufficient Chapter 3: Evaluating inductive arguments and probabilistic and statistical fallacies  164 condition test since it is never present (thus, there can never be a case where B is present but S is absent). However, in order to rigorously test B as a sufficient condition, we have to look for cases in which B is present and then see if our target condition S is absent. We have rigorously tested B as a sufficient condition only if we have collected data in which B is present. Otherwise, we don\u2019t really know whether B is a sufficient condition or not. In rigorous testing, we are actively looking for (or trying to createsituations in which a candidate feature fails one of the tests. That is why when rigorously testing a candidate for the necessary condition test, we must seek out cases in which the candidate is not present, whereas when rigorously testing a candidate for the sufficient condition test, we must seek out cases in which the candidate is present. In the example above, A is not rigorously tested as a necessary condition and B is not rigorously tested as a sufficient condition. If we are interested in finding a cause, we should always rigorously test each candidate. This means that we should always have a mix of different situations where the candidates and targets are sometimes present and sometimes absent.",
