    "What is a conditional statement?",
    "A conditional statement is an if-then statement, where the truth of the antecedent implies the truth of the consequent. For example, \"If it rains, then the ground gets wet.\"",
    "That will be the next line of the proof:  11. L v G Addition 10  At this point, our strategy should be to try to derive the other conjunct, \u201c~R\u201d. Notice that \u201c~R\u201d is contained within the sentence on line 4, but it is embedded. How can we \u201cget it free\u201d? Start by noticing that the ~R is a part of a disjunction, which is itself a consequent of a conditional statement. Also notice that we have already derived the antecedent of that conditional statement, which means that we can use modus ponens to derive the consequent:  Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  111 12. ~R v D Modus ponens 4, 10  The penultimate step is to use a disjunctive syllogism to derive \u201c~R\u201d. 13. ~R Disjunctive syllogism 6, 12  The final step is simply to conjoin lines 11 and 13 to get the conclusion:  14. (L v G\u22c5 ~R Conjunction 11, 13  Thus, here is the completed proof:  1. (~A v B) \u2283 L 2. ~B 3. A \u2283 B 4. L \u2283 (~R v D) 5.",
