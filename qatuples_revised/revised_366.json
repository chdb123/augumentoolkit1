    "They are both cowboys.",
    "Bob and Sally kissed. 7. A person who plays both mandolin and guitar is a multi- instrumentalist. 8. No one has ever contracted rabies and lived. 9. Jack and Jill are cowboys. 10. Josiah is Amish; nevertheless, he is also a drug dealer. 11. The Tigers are the best baseball team in the state, but they are not as good as the Yankees. 12. Bob went to the beach to enjoy some rest and relaxation. 13. Lauren isn\u2019t the fastest runner on the team; still, she is fast enough to have made it to the national championship. 14. The ring is beautiful, but expensive. 15. It is sad, but true that many Americans do not know where their next meal will come from. 2.3. Negation and disjunction  In this section we will introduce the second and third truth-functional connectives: negation and disjunction. We will start with negation, since it is the easier of the two to grasp. Negation is the truth-functional operator that switches the truth value of a proposition from false to true or from true to false. For example, if the statement \u201cdogs are mammals\u201d is true (which it is), then we can make that statement false by adding a negation. In English, the negation is most naturally added just before the noun phrase that follows the linking verb like this:  Dogs are not mammals.",
