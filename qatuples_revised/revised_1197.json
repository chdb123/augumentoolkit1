    "The classic example used to illustrate vagueness is the \u201csorites paradox.\u201d The term \u201csorites\u201d is the Greek term for \u201cheap\u201d and the paradox comes from ancient Greek philosophy. Here is the paradox. I will give you two claims that each sound very plausible, but in fact lead to a paradox. Here are the two claims:  1. One grain of sand is not a heap of sand. 2. If I start with something that is not a heap of sand, then adding one grain of sand to that will not create a heap of sand. For example, two grains of sand is not a heap, thus (by the second claimneither is three grains of sand. But since three grains of sand is not a heap then (by the second claim again) neither is four grains of sand. You can probably see where this is going. By continuing to add one grain of sand over and over, I will eventually end up with something that is clearly a heap of sand, but that won\u2019t be counted as a heap of sand if we accept both claims 1 and 2 above. Chapter 4: Informal fallacies  197  Philosophers continue to argue and debate about how to resolve the sorites paradox, but the point for us is just to illustrate the concept of vagueness. The concept \u201cheap\u201d is a vague concept in this example. But so are so many other concepts, such a color concepts (red, yellow, green, etc.",
