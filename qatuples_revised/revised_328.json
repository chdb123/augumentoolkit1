    "What makes an argument valid when using 'and' as a conjunction?",
    "An argument using 'and' as a conjunction is valid if both statements are true; if one statement is false, the entire argument is false.",
    "These two statements are conjoined with an \u201cand.\u201d So the conjunction is really two statements that are conjoined by the \u201cand.\u201d Thus, if I have told you that it is both sunny and warm today, it follows logically that it is sunny today. Here is that simple argument in standard form:  1. It is sunny today and it is warm today. 2. Therefore, it is sunny today. (from 1 This is a valid inference that passes the informal test of validity. But we can also see that the form of the inference is perfectly general because it would work equally well for any conjunction, not just this one. This inference has a particular form that we could state using placeholders for the statements, \u201cit is sunny today\u201d and \u201cit is warm today\u201d:  1. A and B 2. Therefore, A  We can see that any argument that had this form would be a valid argument. For example, consider the statement:   Kant was a deontologist and a Pietist. Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  52  That statement is a conjunction of two statements that we can capture explicitly in the first premise of the following argument:  1. Kant was a deontologist and Kant was a Pietist. 2. Therefore, Kant was a deontologist.",
