    "What does P(a) represent in a conjunction probability calculation?",
    "P(arepresents the probability of an event occurring.",
    "Since we are asking what is the probability that these two events both occur, this is a matter of calculating the probability of a joint occurrence. In the following, \u201ca\u201d and \u201cb\u201d will refer to independent events, and the locution \u201cP(a)\u201d stands for \u201cthe probability of a.\u201d Here is how we calculate the probability of conjunctions:   P(a and b= P(a) \u00d7 P(b)   So, to apply this to my example of drawing two queens, we have to multiply the probability of drawing one queen, \u201cP(a)\u201d by the probability of drawing yet another queen, \u201cP(b).\u201d Since we have already calculated the probability of drawing a queen at .077, the math is quite simple:   .077 \u00d7 .077 = .0059  That is, there a less than 1% chance (.59% to be precise) of drawing two queens in this scenario. So, obviously, you\u2019d not be wise to place a bet on that happening! Let\u2019s try another example where we have to calculate the probability of a conjunction. Suppose I want to know what the probability that both my father and mother will die of brain cancer. (Macabre, I know.) I\u2019d have to know the probability of dying of brain cancer, which is about 5/100,000. That is, 5 out of every 100,000 people die of brain cancer. That is a very small number: .00005.",
