    "How does a false dichotomy differ from a constructive dilemma?",
    "A false dichotomy and a constructive dilemma both involve disjunctions, but a false dichotomy presents two options as the only ones, while a constructive dilemma forces the listener to choose between them. A false dichotomy is a fallacy; a constructive dilemma can be valid or invalid.",
    "Chapter 4: Informal fallacies  194  This argument contains a fallacy called a \u201cfalse dichotomy.\u201d A false dichotomy is simply a disjunction that does not exhaust all of the possible options. In this case, the problematic disjunction is the first premise: either raising the taxes on the wealthy will hurt the economy or it will help it. But these aren\u2019t the only options. Another option is that raising taxes on the wealthy will have no effect on the economy. Notice that the argument above has the form of a disjunctive syllogism:   A v B  ~A  \u2234 B  However, since the first premise presents two options as if they were the only two options, when in fact they aren\u2019t, the first premise is false and the argument fails. Notice that the form of the argument is perfectly good\u2014the argument is valid. The problem is that this argument isn\u2019t sound because the first premise of the argument commits the false dichotomy fallacy. False dichotomies are commonly encountered in the context of a disjunctive syllogism or constructive dilemma (see chapter 2). In a speech made on April 5, 2004, President Bush made the following remarks about the causes of the Iraq war:  Saddam Hussein once again defied the demands of the world.",
