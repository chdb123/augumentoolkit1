    "How does the double negation in premise 2 contribute to the validity of the inference?",
    "The double negation in premise 2 cancels out the negation in the left disjunct, making it a positive statement, which allows for a valid inference when combined with the second disjunct.",
    "~~A 3. \u2234 B \u22c5 C  is a valid inference because it has the same form as disjunctive syllogism. The first premise is a disjunction (since the wedge is the main operator), the second premise is simply the negation of the left disjunct, \u201c~A\u201d, and the conclusion is the right disjunct of the original disjunction. It may help you to see the form of the argument if you treat \u201c~A\u201d as the p and \u201cB \u22c5 C\u201d as the q. Also notice that the second premise contains a double negation. Your English teacher may tell you never to use double negatives, but as far as logic is concerned, there is absolutely nothing wrong with a double negation. In this case, our left disjunct in premise 1 is itself a negation, while premise 2 is simply a negation of that left disjunct. The next rule we\u2019ll introduce is called \u201caddition.\u201d It is not quite as \u201cobvious\u201d a rule as the ones we\u2019ve introduced above. However, once you understand the conditions under which a disjunction is true, then it should be obvious why this form of inference is valid. Addition has the following form:  1. p 2.",
