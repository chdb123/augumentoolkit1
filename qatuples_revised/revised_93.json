    "How does the first argument connect consensual and economic interactions with prostitution?",
    "The first argument states that if there is nothing wrong with consensual and economic interactions between adults, then there's nothing wrong with prostitution. It compares a man paying for sex to going on a date and buying dinner for a woman.",
    "At this point, it is important to understand that arguments can have these different structures and that some arguments will be longer and more complex than others. Determining the structure of very Chapter 1: Reconstructing and analyzing arguments  14 complex arguments is a skill that takes some time to master. Even so, it may help to remember that any argument structure ultimately traces back to some combination of these. Exercise 4: Write the following arguments in standard form and show how the argument is structured using a diagram like the ones I have used in this section. 1. There is nothing wrong with prostitution because there is nothing wrong with consensual sexual and economic interactions between adults. Moreover, since there\u2019s no difference between a man who goes on a blind date with a woman, buys her dinner and then has sex with her and a man who simply pays a woman for sex, that is another reason for why there is nothing wrong with prostitution. 2. Prostitution is wrong because it involves women who have typically been sexually abused as children. We know that most of these women have been abused from multiple surveys done with women who have worked in prostitution and that show a high percentage of self-reported sexual abuse as children. 3. There was someone in this cabin recently because there was warm water in the tea kettle and because there was wood still smoldering in the fireplace. But the person couldn\u2019t have been Tim because Tim has been with me the whole time. Therefore, there must be someone else in these woods.",
