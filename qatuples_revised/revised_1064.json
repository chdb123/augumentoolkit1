    "What is the probability of rolling a five on your first throw and another five on the second throw of that die?",
    "To calculate this, we use the rule for conjunctions: (1/6\u00d7 (1/6) = 1/36. So the probability is 16.7% or 1 in 92.",
    "That is simply the probability of the conjunction of 6 events, each of which has the probability of .5 (or 50%):   .5 \u00d7 .5 \u00d7 .5 \u00d7 .5 \u00d7 .5 \u00d7 .5 = .015 (or 1.5% Then we simply use the rule for calculating the probability of a negation, since we want to know the chances that we don\u2019t flip 6 tails in a row (i.e., we flip at least one head):   1 \u2013 .015 = .985  So the probability of flipping at least one head in 6 flips of the coin is 98.5%. (It would be exactly the same probability of flipping at least one tails in 6 flips.) Exercise 27: Use the three different rules of calculating probabilities (conjunctions, negations, disjunctions) to calculate the following probabilities, which all related to fair, six-sided dice. 1. What is the probability of rolling a five on one throw one die? 2. What is the probability of not rolling a five on one throw of one die? Chapter 3: Evaluating inductive arguments and probabilistic and statistical fallacies  176 3. What is the probability of rolling a five on your first throw and another five on the second throw of that die? 4. If you roll two dice at one time, what are the chances of rolling two twos? 5.",
