    "How does the heated exchange between Sally and Bob differ from an argument in the logical sense?",
    "In the logical sense, an argument is not a heated exchange of conflicting views; it's a reasoned justification for a claim's truth.",
    "Van Cleave January 4, 2016 Chapter 1: Reconstructing and analyzing arguments  1 1.1 What is an argument? This is an introductory textbook in logic and critical thinking. Both logic and critical thinking centrally involve the analysis and assessment of arguments. \u201cArgument\u201d is a word that has multiple distinct meanings, so it is important to be clear from the start about the sense of the word that is relevant to the study of logic. In one sense of the word, an argument is a heated exchange of differing views as in the following:  Sally: Abortion is morally wrong and those who think otherwise are seeking to justify murder! Bob: Abortion is not morally wrong and those who think so are right-wing bigots who are seeking to impose their narrow-minded views on all the rest of us! Sally and Bob are having an argument in this exchange. That is, they are each expressing conflicting views in a heated manner. However, that is not the sense of \u201cargument\u201d with which logic is concerned. Logic concerns a different sense of the word \u201cargument.\u201d An argument, in this sense, is a reason for thinking that a statement, claim or idea is true. For example:  Sally: Abortion is morally wrong because it is wrong to take the life of an innocent human being, and a fetus is an innocent human being. In this example Sally has given an argument against the moral permissibility of abortion.",
