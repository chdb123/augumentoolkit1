    "If candidate X favored environmental policies while candidate Y supported economic growth, how might that impact the results of a poll on their preference in 'Introduction to Logic and Critical Thinking' by Matthew Van Cleave?",
    "The results of the poll could be influenced by the preferences of voters who prioritize either environmental policies or economic growth, potentially skewing the sample in favor of one candidate over the other. This would make it unrepresentative of the population as a whole. However, if the polling method is inclusive and representative of both groups, the results could be more accurate.",
    "Although the sample would allow us to generalize to the population, \u201cField and Stream subscribers,\u201d it would not allow us to generalize to the population at large. Let\u2019s consider one more example of a sampling bias. Suppose candidate X were running in a district in which there was a high proportion of elderly voters. Suppose that candidate X favored policies that elderly voters were against. For example, suppose candidate X favors slashing Medicare funding to reduce the budget deficit, whereas candidate Y favored maintaining or increasing support to Medicare. Along comes an organization who is interested in polling voters to determine which candidate is favored in the district. Suppose that the organization chooses to administer the poll via text message and that the results of the poll show that 75% of the voters favor candidate X. Can you see what\u2019s wrong with the poll\u2014why it is biased? You probably recognize that this polling Chapter 3: Evaluating inductive arguments and probabilistic and statistical fallacies  144 method will not produce a representative sample because elderly voters are much less likely to use cell phones and text messaging and so the poll will leave out the responses of these elderly voters (who, we\u2019ve assumed make up a large segment of the population). Thus, the sample will be biased and unrepresentative of the target population. As a result, any attempt to generalize to the general population would be extremely ill-advised.",
