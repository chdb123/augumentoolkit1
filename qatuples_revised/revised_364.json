    "Which of the following sentences are truth-functional conjunctions? Identify the two conjuncts in sentence 3.",
    "Sentence 3 is not a truth-functional conjunction, as Tom being a fireman and John Lennon being a father are not independent propositions (Tom could be a fireman without John Lennon being one). The two conjuncts are \"Tom is a fireman\" and \"John Lennon is a father.\"",
    "Unlike the previous example, in this case we can clearly identify two propositions whose truth values are independent of each other:   Maya is a woman  Alice is a woman  Whether or not Maya is a woman is an issue that is totally independent of whether Alice is a woman (and vice versa). That is, the fact that Maya is a woman tells us nothing about whether Alice is a woman. In contrast, the fact that Maya is married to Alice implies that Alice is married to Maya. So the way to determine whether or not a conjunction is truth-functional is to ask whether it is formed from two propositions whose truth is independent of each other. If there are two propositions whose truth is independent of each other, then the conjunction is truth-functional; if there are not two propositions whose truth is independent of each other, the conjunction is not truth-functional. Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  58  Exercise 8: Identify which of the following sentences are truth-functional conjunctions. If the sentence is a truth-functional conjunction, identify the two conjuncts (by writing them down). 1. Jack and Jill are coworkers. 2. Tom is a fireman and a father. 3. Ringo Starr and John Lennon were bandmates. 4. Lucy loves steak and onion sandwiches. 5. Cameron Dias has had several relationships, although she has never married. 6.",
