    "If both your seatbelt is buckled and you do not get a ticket are true propositions, what does their disjunction (v) represent?",
    "Their disjunction (vrepresents True. This means that either one or both of the statements can be true for the disjunction to be true. In this case, it's true because your seatbelt is buckled and you do not get a ticket. However, if your seatbelt was unbuckled but you still got a ticket, the disjunction would also be true. The inclusive or allows for both scenarios.",
    "In our symbolic language, the symbol we will use to represent a disjunction is called a \u201cwedge\u201d (v). (You can simply use a lowercase \u201cv\u201d to write the wedge.Here is the truth table for disjunction:          As before, the header of this truth table represents two propositions (first two columns) and their disjunction (last column). The following four rows represent the conditions under which the disjunction is true. As we have seen, the disjunction is true when at least one of its disjuncts is true, including when they are both true (the first three rows). A disjunction is false only if both disjuncts are false (last row).
