    "What is the fallacy of composition?",
    "The fallacy of composition occurs when one assumes that what is true for parts must also be true for the whole, or vice versa. It is an informal fallacy and cannot be identified without understanding the concepts involved in the argument. An example would be \"This apple is red, so all apples are red.\" This ignores individual variations within a group.",
    "It is mark of a formal fallacy that we can identify it even if we don\u2019t really understand the meanings of the sentences in the argument. Recall our Jabberwocky argument from chapter 2. Here\u2019s an argument which uses silly, made-up words from Lewis Carrol\u2019s \u201cJabberwocky.\u201d See if you can determine whether the argument\u2019s form is valid or invalid:  1. If toves are brillig then toves are slithy. 2. Toves are slithy 3. Therefore, toves are brillig. You should be able to see that this argument has the form of affirming the consequent:  1. B \u2283 S 2. S 3. \u2234 B  As such, we know that the argument is invalid, even though we haven\u2019t got a clue what \u201ctoves\u201d are or what \u201cslithy\u201d or \u201cbrillig\u201d means. The point is that we can identify formal fallacies without having to know what they mean. In contrast, informal fallacies are those which cannot be identified without understanding the concepts involved in the argument. A paradigm example of an informal fallacy is the fallacy of composition. We will consider this fallacy in the next sub-section. In the remaining subsections, we will consider a number of other informal logical fallacies.",
