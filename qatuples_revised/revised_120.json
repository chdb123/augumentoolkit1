    "Why is the argument 'Everyone born in France can speak French' and 'Barack Obama was born in France' a valid argument, even though both premises are false?",
    "The argument is valid because if we assume \"Violet is a dog\" is true, then, since all dogs are mammals, it follows that \"Violet is a mammal\" must be true. In the same way, even though Barack Obama was born in France but not everyone born there can speak French, the conclusion still follows from the premises, making it valid. However, the argument is unsound because both premises are false.",
    "Another way of putting this is as a conditional statement: A valid argument is an argument in which if the premises are true, the conclusion must be true. Here is an example of a valid argument:  1. Violet is a dog 2. Therefore, Violet is a mammal (from 1 You might wonder whether it is true that Violet is a dog (maybe she\u2019s a lizard or a buffalo\u2014we have no way of knowing from the information given). But, for the purposes of validity, it doesn\u2019t matter whether premise 1 is actually true or false. All that matters for validity is whether the conclusion follows from the premise. And we can see that the conclusion, Violet is a mammal, does seem to follow from the premise, Violet is a dog. That is, given the truth of the premise, the conclusion has to be true. This argument is clearly valid since if we assume that \u201cViolet is a dog\u201d is true, then, since all dogs are mammals, it follows that \u201cViolet is a mammal\u201d must also be true. As we\u2019ve just seen, whether or not an argument is valid has nothing to do with whether the premises of the argument are actually true or not. We can illustrate this with another example, where the premises are clearly false:  1. Everyone born in France can speak French 2. Barack Obama was born in France 3. Therefore, Barack Obama can speak French (from 1-2)  This is a valid argument.",
