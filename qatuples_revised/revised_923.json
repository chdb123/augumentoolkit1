    "What are some common explanatory virtues in scientific hypotheses?",
    "Common explanatory virtues include falsifiability, simplicity, and parsimony (fewer entities or processes).",
    "For example, if you say that the explanation isn\u2019t falsifiable, then you need to make sure you give the right explanation of why it isn\u2019t falsifiable (i.e., that there is no evidence that could ever show that the hypothesis is false). In contrast, if the explanation lacks simplicity, you\u2019d have to say that there is another explanation that can equally explain all the observed facts but that posits fewer entities or processes. Exercise 23: Identify which explanatory virtues, if any, the following explanations lack and explain why it lacks that particular virtue. If there is a better explanation, suggest what it might be. 1. Bob explains the fact that he can\u2019t remember what happened yesterday by saying that he must have been kidnapped by aliens, who performed surgery on him and then erased his memory of everything that happened the day before returning him to his house. 2. Mrs. Jones hears strange noises at night such as the creaking of the floor downstairs and rattling of windows. She explains these phenomena by hypothesizing that there is a 37-pound badger that inhabits the house and that emerges at night in search of Wheat Thins and Oreos. 3. Edward saw his friend Tom at the store in their hometown of Lincoln, Nebraska just an hour ago. Then, while watching the World Cup on television, he saw someone that looked just like Tom in the crowd at the game in Brazil.",
