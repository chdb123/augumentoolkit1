    "How does the Jabberwocky argument demonstrate affirming the consequent?",
    "In the Jabberwocky argument, it goes like this: 1. If toves are brillig then toves are slithy. 2. Toves are slithy 3. Therefore, toves are brillig. This is invalid because it assumes that if the consequence (toves are slithyholds, then the premise (toves are brillig) must also hold.",
    "It is mark of a formal fallacy that we can identify it even if we don\u2019t really understand the meanings of the sentences in the argument. Recall our Jabberwocky argument from chapter 2. Here\u2019s an argument which uses silly, made-up words from Lewis Carrol\u2019s \u201cJabberwocky.\u201d See if you can determine whether the argument\u2019s form is valid or invalid:  1. If toves are brillig then toves are slithy. 2. Toves are slithy 3. Therefore, toves are brillig. You should be able to see that this argument has the form of affirming the consequent:  1. B \u2283 S 2. S 3. \u2234 B  As such, we know that the argument is invalid, even though we haven\u2019t got a clue what \u201ctoves\u201d are or what \u201cslithy\u201d or \u201cbrillig\u201d means. The point is that we can identify formal fallacies without having to know what they mean. In contrast, informal fallacies are those which cannot be identified without understanding the concepts involved in the argument. A paradigm example of an informal fallacy is the fallacy of composition. We will consider this fallacy in the next sub-section. In the remaining subsections, we will consider a number of other informal logical fallacies.",
