    "What is a false dichotomy fallacy?",
    "A false dichotomy fallacy is a logical fallacy that presents only two options as possible solutions to a problem, when there are actually more.",
    "And so I had a choice: Do I take the word of a madman, do I trust a person who had used weapons of mass destruction on his own people, plus people in the neighborhood, or do I take the steps necessary to defend the country? Given that choice, I will defend America every time. The false dichotomy here is the claim that:   Either I trust the word of a madman or I defend America (by going to war against Saddam Hussein\u2019s regime). The problem is that these aren\u2019t the only options. Other options include ongoing diplomacy and economic sanctions. Thus, even if it true that Bush shouldn\u2019t have trusted the word of Hussein, it doesn\u2019t follow that the only other Chapter 4: Informal fallacies  195 option is going to war against Hussein\u2019s regime. (Furthermore, it isn\u2019t clear in what sense this was needed to defend America.That is a false dichotomy. As with all the previous informal fallacies we\u2019ve considered, the false dichotomy fallacy requires an understanding of the concepts involved. Thus, we have to use our understanding of world in order to assess whether a false dichotomy fallacy is being committed or not. 4.1.5 Equivocation  Consider the following argument:  Children are a headache. Aspirin will make headaches go away. Therefore, aspirin will make children go away. This is a silly argument, but it illustrates the fallacy of equivocation.",
