    "The method for proving arguments are valid or invalid is the method of proof, which involves showing that the conclusion logically follows from the premises using rules and principles of logic.",

That method is the truth table test of validity. We have also learned a formal method for proving arguments are valid or invalid (the method of proof). The other important skill we have learned in this chapter so far is translating sentences into propositional logic. Thus, there are three different skills that you should know how to do:   1. Translate sentences from English into propositional logic 2. Construct truth tables in order to determine whether an argument is valid or invalid 3.",
