    "How does breaking apart a conjunction help in logical reasoning?",
    "Breaking apart a conjunction helps to see where to go next and allows for further deduction or simplification.",
    "To utilize the strategy of working forward, we simply ask ourselves what rules we can apply to the existing premises to derive something, even if it isn\u2019t the conclusion we are ultimately trying to derive. As a part of this strategy, we should typically break apart a conjunction whenever we have one as a premise of our argument. Doing this can help to see where to go next. (If you\u2019ve ever played Scrabble, then you can think of this as rearranging your Scrabble tiles in order to see what words you can build.Here is an example of a proof where we should utilize the strategy of working forward:  1. A \u22c5 B 2. B \u2283 C /\u2234 C  Notice that since the conclusion is atomic, we cannot utilize the strategy of working backwards. Instead, we should try working forward. As part of this strategy, we should break apart conjunctions by using the rule \u201csimplification.\u201d  That will be the first step of our proof:  1. A \u22c5 B 2. B \u2283 C /\u2234 C 3. A  Simplification 1 4. B  Simplification 1  The first two lines of the proof is just breaking down the conjunction in line 1, where line 3 is just the left conjunct and line 4 is just the right conjunct. Both lines 3 and 4 follow by the same rule and the same line, in this case.",
