    "Why is claim A stronger than claim E, and how does this affect the validity of arguments?",
    "Claim A requires every U.S. President to be monogamous, making it less likely to be true. Claim E only needs at least one U.S. President to be monogamous, so it's more likely to be true. Stronger claims are less likely to be valid, and weaker ones more likely.",
    "Almost all U.S. Presidents were monogamous C. Most U.S. Presidents were monogamous Chapter 1: Reconstructing and analyzing arguments  34 D. Many U.S. Presidents were monogamous E. Some U.S. Presidents were monogamous  The weakest of these claims is E, whereas the strongest is A and each claims descending from A-E is increasingly weaker. It doesn\u2019t take very much for E to be true: there just has to be at least one U.S. President who was monogamous. In contrast, A is much less likely than E to be true because it require every U.S. President to have been monogamous. One way of thinking about this is that any time A is true, it is also true that B-E is true, but B-E could be true without A being true. That is what it means for a claim to be stronger or weaker. A weak claim is more likely to be true whereas a strong claim is less likely to be true. E is much more likely to be true than A. Likewise, D is somewhat more likely to be true than C, and so on. So, guarding involves taking a stronger claim and making it weaker so there is less room to object to the claim.",
