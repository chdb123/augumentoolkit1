    "How do descriptive statements and normative statements differ, according to the author?",
    "Descriptive statements are factual claims about what is true, while normative statements are about what ought to be true, relative to a standard.",
    "However, as it stands, this argument is invalid because it depends on certain missing premises. The conclusion of this argument is a normative statement\u2014 a statement about whether something ought to be true, relative to some standard of evaluation. Normative statements can be contrasted with descriptive statements, which are simply factual claims about what is true. For example, \u201cRussia does not allow gay couples to raise children\u201d is a descriptive statement. That is, it is simply a claim about what is in fact the case in Russia today. In contrast, \u201cRussia should not allow gay couples to raise children\u201d is a normative statement since it is not a claim about what is true, but what ought to Chapter 1: Reconstructing and analyzing arguments  28 be true, relative to some standard of evaluation (for example, a moral or legal standard). An important idea within philosophy, which is often traced back to the Scottish philosopher David Hume (1711-1776), is that statements about what ought to be the case (i.e., normative statementscan never be derived from statements about what is the case (i.e., descriptive statements). This is known within philosophy as the is-ought gap. The problem with the above argument is that it attempts to infer a normative statement from a purely descriptive statement, violating the is-ought gap. We can see the problem by constructing a counterexample. Suppose that in society x it is true that children raised by gay couples have psychological problems.",
