    "How does the validity of an argument depend on its form, according to the text?",
    "The validity of an argument depends on its form; if the argument is in a valid form, it will always be valid regardless of the meaning of its premises.",
    "No, because it isn\u2019t a row in which both the premises are true. Finally, consider the last row. Is that a row in which all the premises are true and yet the conclusion false? Again, the answer is \u201cno\u201d because the premises aren\u2019t both true in that row. Thus, we can see that there is no row of the truth table in which the premises are all true and yet the conclusion is false. And that means the argument is valid. Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  81 Since the truth table test of validity is a formal method of evaluating an argument\u2019s validity, we can determine whether an argument is valid just in virtue of its form, without even knowing what the argument is about! Here is an example:  1. (A v Bv C 2. ~A 3. \u2234 C  Here is an argument written in our symbolic language. I don\u2019t know what A, B, and C mean (i.e., what atomic propositions they stand for), but it doesn\u2019t matter because we can determine whether the argument is valid without having to know what A, B, and C mean. A, B, and C could be any atomic propositions whatsoever. If this argument form is invalid then whatever meaning we give to A, B, and C, the argument will always be invalid. On the other hand, if this argument form is valid, then whatever meaning we give to A, B, and C, the argument will always be valid.",
