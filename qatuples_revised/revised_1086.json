    "The base rate of colon cancer in the given population is .5%.",
    "In the above scenario, the prior probability (i.e., before the testthat you have colon cancer is really, really low. And that means that even after the test we should suspect that the probability is still fairly low. That\u2019s the logic of the matter and we can understand that conceptually without actually even getting into the math. But since we are given numbers to work with, we can actually use math to figure the actual probability that you have colon cancer. Here is how we do it. Let\u2019s suppose that our population is 100,000 people. The base rate tells us that .5% of the population has colon cancer. That means that of the 100,000 people only 500 of them have colon cancer. If we were to apply the 95% accurate test to 500 people, the test would correctly diagnose 475 of them. That is, the test would deliver 475 correct identifications. These are called true positives. However, the test will also mistakenly tell us that some of the people who don\u2019t have colon cancer actually do have it. When this happens, it is called a false positive. Our base rate tells us that most of our population (99,500) do not have colon cancer and the 95% accurate test will misdiagnose 5% of those has having colon cancer. This comes out to 4975 false positives!",
