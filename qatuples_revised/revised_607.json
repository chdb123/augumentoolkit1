    "How does one use modus tollens to complete a proof with a complex consequent?",
    "To use modus tollens with a complex consequent, you need both the negated antecedent and the negated consequent of the conditional statement. Then, apply the rule (if we have the negated consequent and the second premise, we can infer the consequentto derive the original conclusion. This is done by applying modus tollens twice: first negating the consequent, then using modus ponens with the negated antecedent and the second premise.",
    "This is so even though the consequent of the conditional is itself complex (i.e., it is a disjunction). That doesn\u2019t matter. The first premise is still a conditional statement (since the horseshoe is the main operatorand the second premise is the negated consequent of that conditional statement. The rule modus tollens says that if we have that much, we are entitled to infer the negated antecedent of the conditional. Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  99  We can use modus tollens to complete the proof we started above:  1. (R v S) \u2283 (T \u2283 K) 2. ~K 3. R v S /\u2234 ~T 4. T \u2283 K Modus ponens, lines 1, 3 5. ~T  Modus tollens, lines 2, 4  Notice that the last line of the proof is the conclusion that we are supposed to derive and that each statement that I have derived (i.e., lines 4 and 5) has a rule to the right. That rule cited is the rule that justifies the statement that is being derived and the lines cited are the previous lines of the proof where we can see that the rule applies. This is what is called a proof.",
