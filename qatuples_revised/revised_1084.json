    "What is conditional probability and how does it relate to the base rate fallacy?",
    "Conditional probability considers the likelihood of an event occurring given other factors, such as a test result. The base rate fallacy occurs when one ignores this context and assumes high accuracy implies a high chance of a rare condition.",
    "(The test will also misdiagnose those who don\u2019t actually have colon cancer 5% of the time.Many people would be inclined to say that, given the test and its accuracy, there is a 95% chance that you have colon cancer. However, if you are like most people and are inclined to answer this way, you are wrong. In fact, you have committed the fallacy of ignoring the base rate (i.e., the base rate fallacy). The base rate in this example is the rate of those who have colon cancer in a population. There is very small percentage of the population that actually has colon cancer (let\u2019s suppose it is .005 or .5%), so the probability that you have it must take into account the very low probability that you are one of the few that have it. That is, prior to the test (and not taking into account any other details about you), there was a very low probability that you have it\u2014that is, a half of one percent chance (.5%). Yes, the test is 95% accurate, but given the very low prior probability that you have colon cancer, we cannot simply now say that there is a 95% chance that you have it. Rather, we must temper that figure with the very low base rate. The general point is this: when a condition (x) is very rare, then even if a highly accurate test identifies condition (x) as being present, we should still suspect that condition (x) is not present.",
