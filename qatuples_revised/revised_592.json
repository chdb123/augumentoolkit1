    "How many rows would a truth table for R v S /\u2234 ~T have, according to 'Introduction to Logic and Critical Thinking' by Matthew Van Cleave?",
    "A truth table for R v S /\u2234 ~T would have 16 rows, as there are four different atomic propositions (R, S, T, and Kin the argument. If there were more or less, it would be shorter or longer accordingly. However, a proof using modus ponens can establish its validity with only two additional lines.",
    "R v S /\u2234 ~T  (Note: in this section I will be writing the conclusion of the argument to the right of the last premise\u2014in this case premise 3. As before, the conclusion we are trying to derive is denoted by the \u201ctherefore\u201d sign, \u201c\u2234\u201d.We could attempt to prove this argument is valid with a truth table, but the truth table would be 16 rows long because there are four different atomic propositions that occur in this argument, R, S, T, and K. If there were 5 or 6 different atomic propositions, the truth table would be 32 or 64 lines long! However, as we will soon see, we could also prove this argument is valid with only two additional lines. That seems a much more efficient way of establishing that this argument is valid. We will do this a little later\u2014after we have introduced the 8 valid forms of inference that you will need in order to do proofs. Each line of the proof will be justified by citing one of these rules, with the last line of the proof being the conclusion that we are trying to ultimately establish. I will introduce the 8 valid forms of inference in groups, starting with the rules that utilize the horseshoe and negation. The first of the 8 forms of inference is \u201cmodus ponens\u201d which is Latin for \u201cway that affirms.\u201d Modus ponens has the following form:  1. p \u2283 q 2. p 3.",
