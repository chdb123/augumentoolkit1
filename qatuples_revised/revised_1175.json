    "But if one doesn\u2019t already accept the conclusion, then simply restating the conclusion in a different way isn\u2019t going to convince them. Rather, a good argument will provide some reason for accepting the conclusion that is sufficiently independent of that conclusion itself. Begging the question utterly fails to do this and this is why it counts as an informal fallacy. What is interesting about begging the question is that there is absolutely nothing wrong with the argument formally. Chapter 4: Informal fallacies  193 Whether or not an argument begs the question is not always an easy matter to sort out. As with all informal fallacies, detecting it requires a careful understanding of the meaning of the statements involved in the argument. Here is an example of an argument where it is not as clear whether there is a fallacy of begging the question:  Christian belief is warranted because according to Christianity there exists a being called \u201cthe Holy Spirit\u201d which reliably guides Christians towards the truth regarding the central claims of Christianity.1  One might think that there is a kind of circularity (or begging the questioninvolved in this argument since the argument appears to assume the truth of Christianity in justifying the claim that Christianity is true. But whether or not this argument really does beg the question is something on which there is much debate within the sub-field of philosophy called epistemology (\u201cstudy of knowledge\u201d).",
