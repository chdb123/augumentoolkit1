    "What does it mean for something to be mortal, and how does that relate to dying?",
    "Mortal means capable of dying; something mortal will eventually die unless prevented from doing so.",
    "Here is what the three category Venn looks like for the premises:  Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  131   We need a three category Venn for the premises since the two premises refer to three different categories. The way you should construct the Venn is with the circle that represents the \u201cS\u201d category of the conclusion (i.e., the category \u201chumans\u201don left, the circle that represents the \u201cP\u201d category of the conclusion (i.e., the category \u201cthings that die\u201d) on the right, and the remaining category (\u201cthings that are mortal\u201d) in the middle, as I have done above. Constructing your three category Venn in this way will allow you to easily determine whether the argument is valid. The next thing we must do is represent the information from the first two premises in our three category Venn. We\u2019ll start with the first premise, which says \u201call humans are things that are mortal.\u201d That means that we must shade out anything that is in the \u201chuman\u201d category, but that isn\u2019t in the \u201cthings that are mortal\u201d category, like this:   Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  132 The next thing we have to do is fill in the information for the second premise, all things that are mortal are things that die. That means that there isn\u2019t anything that is in the category \u201cthings that are mortal\u201d but that isn\u2019t in the \u201cthings that die\u201d category.",
