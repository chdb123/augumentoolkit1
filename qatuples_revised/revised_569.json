    "What does the truth table for the biconditional connective look like?",
    "The truth table for the biconditional connective is not provided in the text. However, it would show identical truth values for p and q under each row, as stated by the author. It can be represented as TT (true when both p and q are trueor FF (false when either p or q is false).",
    "p q ~p \u22c5 ~q ~(p v qT T      F  F  F      F  T T F      F  F  T      F  T F T      T  F  F      F  T F F      T  T  T      T  F  Again, as you can see from the truth table, the truth values under the main operators of each sentence are identical on every row (i.e., for every assignment of truth values to the atomic propositions). In fact, there is a fifth truth functional connective called \u201cmaterial equivalence\u201d or the \u201cbiconditional\u201d that is defined as true when the atomic propositions share the same truth value, and false when the truth values different. Although we will not be relying on the biconditional, I provide the truth table for it below.",
