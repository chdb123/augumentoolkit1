    "Consider these statements: 1. All dogs are mammals. 2. Some cats are mammals. Are these statements valid or invalid according to the Venn test?",
    "These statements are valid according to the Venn test, as both conditions are met: athere isn't anything that is a dog but not a mammal, and b) there could be something that is a mammal but not a dog. However, the conclusion \"all cats are dogs\" would fail the Venn test because it adds information not present in the premise.",
    "2. Therefore, all vehicles are cars. Here are the Venns for the premise and the conclusion, respectively:    In this case, the Venns are clearly not the same. More importantly, we can see that the conclusion Venn (on the rightcontains additional information that is not already contained in the premise Venn. In particular, the conclusion Venn allows that a) there could be things in the \u201ccar\u201d category that aren\u2019t in the \u201cvehicle\u201d category and b) that there cannot be anything in the \u201cvehicle\u201d category that isn\u2019t also in the \u201ccar\u201d category. That is not information that is contained in the premise Venn, which says that a) there isn\u2019t anything in the category \u201ccar\u201d that isn\u2019t also in the category \u201cvehicle\u201d and b) that there could be things in the category \u201cvehicle\u201d that aren\u2019t in the category \u201ccar.\u201d Thus, this argument does not pass the Venn test of validity since there is information contained in the conclusion Venn that is not already contained in the premise Venn. Thus, this argument is invalid. The Venn test of validity is a formal method, because we can apply it even if we only know the form of the categorical statements, but don\u2019t know what the categories referred to in the statements represent. For example, we can simply use \u201cS\u201d and \u201cP\u201d for the categories\u2014and we clearly don\u2019t know what these represent. For example:  1. All S are P 2.",
