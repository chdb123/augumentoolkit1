    "What is the form of a conjunction?",
    "A conjunction has the form p \u22c5 q.",
    "Bob vacuumed the floor; Sally washed the dishes. Both of these are conjunctions that are represented in the same way. You should see that both of them have the form, p \u22c5 q. Not every conjunction is a truth-function conjunction. We can see this by considering a proposition like the following:  Maya and Alice are married. If this were a truth-functional proposition, then we should be able to identify the two, independent propositions involved. But we cannot. What would those propositions be? You might think two propositions would be these: Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  57  Maya is married  Alice is married  But that cannot be right since the fact that Maya is married and that Alice is married is not the same as saying that Maya and Alice are married to each other, which is clearly the implication of the original sentence. Furthermore, if you tried to add \u201cto each other\u201d to each proposition, it would no longer make sense:  Maya is married to each other  Alice is married to each other  Perhaps we could say that the two conjuncts are \u201cMaya is married to Alice\u201d and \u201cAlice is married to Maya,\u201d but the truth values of those two conjuncts are not independent of each other since if Maya is married to Alice it must also be true that Alice is married to Maya. In contrast, the following is an example of a truth- functional conjunction:   Maya and Alice are women.",
