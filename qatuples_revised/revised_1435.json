    "What is the difference between a necessary and sufficient cause?",
    "A necessary cause is something without which an event cannot happen, while a sufficient cause is something that, when present, guarantees an event will happen.",
    "B and C are sufficient; C and D are necessary. 10. A and C are sufficient; D is necessary. Exercise 26 1. Accidental 2. B causes A. Perhaps when we are away from home, Charlie gets less exercise, hence putting on more weight. In that case B is (indirectlycausing A, since our being away from home results in Charlie getting less exercise, which results in him gaining more weight. 3. Common cause. The common cause is simply the factors that make plants grow, such a sunlight, water, and good soil. In this case, A and B are not causing each other, but there is something else (i.e., growth factors of plants) that is causing each one, independently to grow. 4. A causes B. The more bombing, the more stress for the president. And the more stress for the president, the more of his hairs fall out. 5. B causes A. Arguably, the average number of fires per year will influence the number of fire engines needed. Fewer fires would require fewer engines (in which case they\u2019d likely retire some); more fires would require more engines (in which case they\u2019d likely acquire some). 6. Common cause: agrarian societies will have more mules and will also probably pay professors less, since higher education is not as important in Answers to exercises  235 an agrarian society. So the common cause is being a (more or less) agrarian society. 7.",
