    "What is the definition of material equivalence or the biconditional?",
    "Material equivalence or the biconditional is true when the atomic propositions share the same truth value, and false when their values differ.",

In fact, there is a fifth truth functional connective called \u201cmaterial equivalence\u201d or the \u201cbiconditional\u201d that is defined as true when the atomic propositions share the same truth value, and false when the truth values different. Although we will not be relying on the biconditional, I provide the truth table for it below.",
