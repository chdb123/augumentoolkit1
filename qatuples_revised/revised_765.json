    "What is the Venn test of validity?",
    "The Venn test of validity evaluates an argument by checking if the conclusion contains information not present in the premise. If it does, the argument fails and is considered invalid.",
    "No P are S   Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  127   The conclusion (on the rightcontains information that is not contained in the premise (on the left). In particular, the conclusion Venn explicitly rules out that there is anything that is both in the category \u201cS\u201d and in the category \u201cP\u201d while the premise Venn allows that this is the case (but does not require it). Thus, we can say that this argument fails the Venn test of validity and thus is invalid. We know this even though we have no idea what the categories \u201cS\u201d and \u201cP\u201d are. This is the mark of a formal method of evaluation. Exercise 19: Apply the Venn test of validity in order to determine whether the following categorical inferences are valid or invalid. 1. All S are P; therefore, all P are S 2. Some S are P; therefore, some P are S 3. Some S are P; therefore, some P are not S 4. Some S are P; therefore, all P are S 5. No S are P; therefore, no P are S 6. No P are S; therefore, some S are P 7. Some S are not P; therefore, some P are not S 8. All S are P; therefore some P are not S   2.16 Universal statements and existential commitment  Consider the following inference:  1. All S are P 2.",
