    "How does the 'sock gnome' hypothesis compare to the 'dog ate the sock' hypothesis in terms of falsifiability?",
    "The 'sock gnome' hypothesis is unfalsifiable because it cannot be shown false, as there's no evidence that could prove its existence or non-existence. In contrast, the 'dog ate the sock' hypothesis is falsifiable, as one can perform surgery on Violet to find remnants of the sock and confirm or disprove it.",
    "But such a hypothesis is a defective hypothesis. Any empirical hypothesis (i.e., a hypothesis that is supposed to explain a set of observed factsmust at least be able to be shown false. The sock gnome hypothesis lacks this virtue\u2014that is, it lacks the explanatory virtue of being falsifiable. In contrast, if I were to hypothesize that our dog, Violet, ate the sock, then this hypothesis is falsifiable. For example, I could perform surgery on Violet and see if I found remnants of a sock. If I didn\u2019t, then I would have shown that the hypothesis is false. If I did, then I would thereby have confirmed the hypothesis. So the \u201cdog ate the sock\u201d hypothesis is falsifiable, and this is a good thing. The difference between a true hypothesis and a false one is simply that the true hypothesis has not yet been shown to be false, whereas the false one has. Falsifiability requires only that it be possible to show that the hypothesis is false. If we look for evidence that would show that the hypothesis is false, but we won\u2019t find that evidence, then we have confirmed that hypothesis. In contrast, an unfalsifiable hypothesis Chapter 3: Evaluating inductive arguments and probabilistic and statistical fallacies  151 cannot be confirmed because we cannot specify any evidence that would show it was false, so we can\u2019t try to look for such evidence (which is what a rigorous scientific methodology requires).",
