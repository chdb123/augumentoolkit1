    "What is the difference between assurances and arguments in critical thinking?",
    "Assurances are statements that something is true without providing evidence, while arguments present reasons to support a claim's truth.",
    "Here are some examples:  Everyone with any sense agrees that\u2026  Of course, no one will deny that\u2026  There is no question that\u2026  No one with any sense would deny that\u2026  Another common way of doing this is by implying that no sensible person would agree with a claim that we are trying to establish as false:  It is no longer held that\u2026  No intelligent person would ever maintain that\u2026  You would have to live under a rock to think that\u2026  Assurances are not necessarily illegitimate, since the person may be right and may in fact have good arguments to back up the claims, but the assurances are not themselves arguments and a critical thinker will always regard them as somewhat suspect. This is especially so when the claim isn\u2019t obviously true. Next, we will turn to guarding. Guarding involves weakening a claim so that it is easier to make that claim true. Here is a simple contrast that will make the point. Consider the following claims:  A. All U.S. Presidents were monogamous B.",
