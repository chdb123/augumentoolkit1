    "What is the main goal of discussing fallacies in 'Introduction to Logic and Critical Thinking' by Matthew Van Cleave?",
    "The main goal of discussing fallacies in Introduction to Logic and Critical Thinking is to make them less obvious and more understandable by explaining what makes them seductive, rather than just listing them as obvious mistakes. He acknowledges influences from other texts like Sinnot-Armstrong and Fogelin's Understanding Arguments and Copi's Introduction to Logic, as well as psychologist Daniel Kahneman's work on the subject.",
    "In my experience, many critical thinking textbooks end up making the fallacies sound obvious; one is often left wondering how anyone could commit such a fallacy. In my discussion of the fallacies I have tried to correct this not only in the particular examples I use in the text and exercises, but also by discussing what makes a particular fallacy seductive. I have used numerous different textbooks over the years that I have been teaching logic and critical thinking courses. Some of them were very good; others were not. Although this textbook is my attempt to improve on what I\u2019ve encountered, I am indebted to a number of textbooks that have shaped how I teach logic and critical thinking. In particular, Sinnott-Armstrong and Fogelin\u2019s Understanding Arguments: An Introduction to Informal Logic and Copi and Cohen\u2019s Introduction to Logic have influenced how I present the material here (although this may not be obvious). My interest in better motivating the seductiveness of the fallacies is influenced by Daniel Kahneman\u2019s work in psychology (for which he won the Nobel Prize in economics in 2002).
