    "What is the probability of picking a queen from a deck of cards with 52 cards?",
    "The probability of picking a queen at random is 4/52, or .07, which is about a 7.7% chance. This means there's approximately a 7.7% likelihood of picking a queen from the deck.",
    "The girth of an adult\u2019s waist (Ais negatively correlated with the height of their vertical leap (B). 9. Olympic marathon times (A) are positively correlated with the temperature during the marathon (B). That is, the more time it takes an Olympic marathoner to complete the race, the higher the temperature. 10. The number gray hairs on an individual\u2019s head (A) is positively correlated with the number of children or grandchildren they have (B). 3.5 Probability  As we have seen, a strong inductive argument is one in which the truth of the premises makes the conclusion highly probable. The distinction between strong inductive arguments and valid (deductive) arguments is that whereas the premises of strong inductive arguments make their conclusions highly probable, the premises of valid arguments make their conclusions certain. We can think of probability as how likely it is that something is (or will be) true, given a particular body of evidence. Using numbers between 0 and 1, we can express probabilities numerically. For example, if I have a full deck of cards and pick one at random, what is the probability that the card I pick is a queen? Since there are 52 cards in the deck, and only four of them are queens, the probability of picking a queen is 4/52, or .077. That is, I have about a 7.7% chance of picking a queen at random.",
