    "An example of an argument with independent but direct support for a conclusion would be: I know that Wanda rode her bike to work today because she was seen on her bike by John (independentand because she had her right pant leg rolled up (direct). Both pieces of evidence support the conclusion, but they are not dependent on each other.",
    "Vesuvius was not actually written by an eyewitness. (from 2 Notice that at the end of statement 2 I have written in parentheses \u201cfrom 1\u201d (and likewise at the end of statement 3 I have written \u201cfrom 2\u201d). This is a shorthand way of saying: \u201cthis statement follows from statement 1.\u201d We will use this convention as a way of keeping track of the structure of the argument. It may also help to think about the structure of an argument spatially, as figure 1 shows:    The main argument here (from 2 to 3) contains a subargument, in this case the argument from 1 to 2. In general, the main argument is simply the argument whose premises directly support the main conclusion, whereas a subargument is an argument that provides indirect support for the main conclusion by supporting one of the premises of the main argument. You can always add further subarguments to the overall structure of an argument by providing evidence that supports one of the unsupported premises. Another type of structure that arguments can have is when two or more premises provide direct but independent support for the conclusion. Here is an example of an argument with that structure:  I know that Wanda rode her bike to work today because when she arrived at work she had her right pant leg rolled up (which cyclists do in order to Chapter 1: Reconstructing and analyzing arguments  13 keep their pants legs from getting caught in the chain).",
