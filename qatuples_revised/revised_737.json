    "What does the Venn diagram represent for the statement 'No reptiles are things that give live birth'?",
    "The Venn diagram represents that there is nothing in the intersection of the two categories, \"reptiles\" and \"things that give live birth.\" It shows that no reptile is both a reptile and gives live birth.",
    "All we have to do is substitute in the name of the subject category (i.e., the \u201cS\u201d termand the description of the predicate category (i.e., the \u201cP\u201d term). Doing that will yield the following sentence:   No reptiles are things that give live birth  Although this sentence sounds strange in English, it has the same form as the categorical form, no S are P, and this translation allows us to clearly see that it does and thus to see what the two categories are. Here is what the Venn diagram for this statement looks like:  Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  120    This Venn diagram represents that there is nothing in the intersection of the two categories, \u201creptiles\u201d and \u201cthings that give live birth.\u201d If you think about it, this is exactly what our original statement was saying: there isn\u2019t anything that is both a reptile and gives live birth. Let\u2019s look at the next statement, \u201csome birds are taller than President Obama.\u201d  This is a statement not about all birds, but about some birds. What are the two categories? One category is clearly \u201cbirds.\u201d The other category is \u201cthings that are taller than President Obama.\u201d That may sound like a strange category, but it is perfectly legitimate category. It includes things like adult ostriches, large grizzly bears standing on their hind legs, giraffes, the Flatiron Building, a school bus, etc.",
