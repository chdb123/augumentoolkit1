    "Conservativeness means that an explanation should not violate our understanding of nature or known facts. It should apply to a wide range of circumstances and be based on existing knowledge.",
    "This would violate what we know about how evolution works (i.e., we probably need a much larger population for this to happen than the population of rats that are contained in only her apartment). Furthermore, the explanation lacks power since a better explanation that applied to a wider range of circumstances is simply that the rats were not taking the bait. 14. Even more clearly than #13, this one lacks conservativeness. There are no known cases of anything being immortal and this idea violates our understanding of the basic laws of nature. Nothing is immortal. 15. Again, this explanation lacks conservativeness (i.e., it violates our understanding of nature which says that nothing is immortal). A better explanation is that the bullets Bob put in his gun were blanks (cf. the movie, Crash). Exercise 24 Answers to exercises  232 1.

Although the similarity is that they are both poodles, there is probably some other characteristic that accounted for me being bitten.
