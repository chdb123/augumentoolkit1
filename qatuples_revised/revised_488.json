    "What does it mean for an argument to be valid, according to the truth table test of validity?",
    "An argument is valid if, for every assignment of truth values to the atomic propositions, if the premises are true then the conclusion is true. It is invalid if there exists an assignment where the premises are true but the conclusion is false.",
    "Thus, every row under the \u201cS v D\u201d column should be true, except for the last row since on the last row both D and S are false (whereas in the first three rows at least one or the other is true). The truth values for the second premise (~Sare easy to determine: we simply look at what we have assigned to \u201cS\u201d in our reference column and then we negate those truth values\u2014the Ts becomes Fs and the Fs becomes Ts. That is just what I\u2019ve done in the fourth column of the truth table above. Finally, the conclusion in the last column of the truth table will simply Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  80 repeat what we have assigned to \u201cD\u201d in our reference column, since the last conclusion simply repeats the atomic proposition \u201cD.\u201d   The above truth table is complete. Now the question is: How do we use this completed truth table to determine whether or not the argument is valid? In order to do so, we must apply what I\u2019ll call the \u201ctruth table test of validity.\u201d  According to the truth table test of validity, an argument is valid if and only if for every assignment of truth values to the atomic propositions, if the premises are true then the conclusion is true. An argument is invalid if there exists an assignment of truth values to the atomic propositions on which the premises are true and yet the conclusion is false. It is imperative that you understand (and not simply memorize) what these definitions mean.",
