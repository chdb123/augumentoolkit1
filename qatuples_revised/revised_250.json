    "In the context of this text, what is an example of a presupposition that could influence truth-acceptance?",
    "The presupposition that Jane isn't smart or a good student might lead people to be more receptive to accepting negative claims about her without explicit evidence.",
    "Since presuppositions are more difficult to challenge, they can end up influencing what people in the conversation are taking for granted and in this way presupposition can influence what people accept as true without any argument or evidence. Of course, a person could explicitly challenge the implicit presupposition that Jane isn\u2019t smart or a good student, but that takes extra effort and many times people don\u2019t realize that a presupposition has just slipped into a conversation. 4 For example, see David Lewis\u2019s \u201cScorekeeping in a Language Game\u201d (1979). Chapter 1: Reconstructing and analyzing arguments  39  I suggest that hybrid evaluative/descriptive terms can work as a kind of presupposition. If I describe someone as an \u201cinsurgent,\u201d for example, I am saying something both descriptive\u2014person who has risen in armed resistance against an existing government\u2014and negatively evaluative since the connotation of the term \u201cinsurgent\u201d (as compared to \u201cfreedom fighter\u201dhas come to be that of someone doing something bad or negative. In using the term \u201cinsurgent\u201d no one has explicitly claimed that the individual/group in question is bad, but because the term has (for us) a negative connotation it can lead us to be more receptive to accepting (implicitly) claims such as that the person/group is bad or is doing something bad/harmful. Thus, like assuring and discounting (section 1.10), evaluative language is a rhetorical technique.",
