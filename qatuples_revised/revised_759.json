    "What makes an argument valid or invalid, according to the Venn test?",
    "An argument is valid if the conclusion Venn contains no additional information that isn't in the premise Venn; otherwise, it's invalid.",
    "No poodle could run faster than a cheetah. 28. No professional runner is slow. 29. Baboons aren\u2019t friendly. 30. Pigs will eat anything. 2.15 The Venn test of validity for immediate categorical inferences  In the last section, we introduced the four categorical forms. Those forms are below. Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  125    We can use Venn diagrams in order to determine whether certain kinds of arguments are valid or invalid. One such type of argument is what we will call \u201cimmediate categorical inferences.\u201d An immediate categorical inference is simply an argument with one premise and one conclusion. For example:  1. Some mammals are amphibious. 2. Therefore, some amphibious things are mammals. If we construct a Venn diagram for the premise and another Venn diagram for the conclusion, we will see that the Venn diagrams are identical to each other. That is, the information that is represented in the Venn for the premise, is exactly the same information represented in the Venn for the conclusion. This argument passes the Venn test of validity because the conclusion Venn contains no additional information that is not already contained in the premise Venn. Thus, this argument is valid. Let\u2019s now turn to an example of an invalid argument. Chapter 2: Formal methods of evaluating arguments  126  1. All cars are vehicles.",
