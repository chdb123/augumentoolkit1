    "How does a disjunctive syllogism differ from a hypothetical syllogism?",
    "A disjunctive syllogism has two premises and a conclusion where the first premise is \"A or B\" and the second premise is \"C,\" while the conclusion is either A or C. The structure is: 1. A \u22c5 C, 2. (A v E), 3. C v D, 4. (A v E\u22c5 (C v D). A hypothetical syllogism has two premises and a conclusion where the first premise is \"If A then B\" and the second premise is C, with the conclusion being B. The structure is: 1. A \u2283 C, 2. C, 3. ~D /\u2234 A \u2283 D",
