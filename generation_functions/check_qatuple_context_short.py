You need to check for vague wording that a reader cannot interpret correctly, and questions that lack key context and would not be possibly answerable even if asked of someone with complete, masterful knowledge of the general subject matter of the question.

Evaluate the provided question-answer pair step-by-step. Following this, at the very end of your response, your "final judgment" or "final answer", you will write "Pass" or "Fail" or "Reword". A test passes if it "makes sense" and does not lack key context; it "Fails" if it lacks key context, AND the question is not specific or clear, it fails. If it lacks context but the question is specific, pointed, and grounded, then it needs to be reworded to have the context-needing terms (i.e., vague reference to "the text") removed. If it has no problems, it passes. 

I want you to especially check for vague references to "the text", "passage", and "book" that do not mention which book is being discussed. If no book is specifically named, the question and answer should not mention books or texts, etc.

Please now apply this method to the provided text and question, and write out your reasoning and thought process.


### Instruction:
Text details: Simple Sabotage, by the Office of Strategic Services, Published 1944
Note that while you have access to this information, for the sake of rewording questions, you should evaluate the question as if you could not see this.

Question: How can you avoid blame for an act of sabotage, according to the text?
Answer: You can do them in public places where anyone would have been capable of carrying out the act.

### Response:
## Reasoning and thought process:
### Question Context Validation
#### Special Term Context Check: Specifically check for use of the terms "book", "text", "passage", and "excerpt" without context about which specific thing is being discussed. This question mentions "the text" without specifying which text it is referring to.
#### Text and Author Specificity: The question fails to mention which passage or book is being referred to, leading to a lack of context.
#### Scope and Precision: The question is specific in asking how to avoid blame for an act of sabotage.

### Answer Context Validation:
#### Special Term Context Check: Specifically check for use of the terms "book", "text", "passage", and "excerpt" without context about which specific thing is being discussed. The answer does not use any of these terms.
#### Specificity and Clarity: The answer is clear in its message and content. It does not introduce any vague context.
#### Answer-Only Context Issues: The answer is straightforward, makes no reference to outside material, and only requires knowledge to provide -- therefore, it is completely valid.

### Critical Evaluation and Final Judgment:
#### Evaluation: Some checks related to the question or answer failed. So this question and answer should be reworded if they can be, or fail otherwise. Both the question and answer are precise, but the question lacks specific context regarding the text it refers to. This necessitates a rewording to include the specific text. The answer passed its checks and will remain untouched.
#### Final judgment: Reword.

### Question Rewording (using text details as reference):
Question: How can you avoid blame for an act of sabotage, according to 'Simple Sabotage' by the Office of Strategic Services?

Question: How does the type of saboteur affect their role in destruction?
Answer: If they are a technician, they can devise methods of simple sabotage appropriate to their facilities. If not technically trained, they need suggestions for what to destroy and how to accomplish it.

### Response:
## Reasoning and thought process:
### Question Context Validation
#### Special Term Context Check: Specifically check for use of the terms "book", "text", "passage", and "excerpt" without context about which specific thing is being discussed. The question does not misuse any specific terms without proper context.
#### Text and Author Specificity: The question does not require a reference to a specific text or author as it is asking about general knowledge.
#### Scope and Precision: The question is precise in asking about the impact of a saboteur's type on their role.

### Answer Context Validation:
#### Special Term Context Check: Specifically check for use of the terms "book", "text", "passage", and "excerpt" without context about which specific thing is being discussed. The answer does not use vague terms without context.
#### Specificity and Clarity: The answer is clear, providing a direct response to the question based on general knowledge.
#### Answer-Only Context Issues: The answer does not introduce any vague or unspecified external material and is valid as it stands.

### Critical Evaluation and Final Judgment:
#### Evaluation: Both the question and answer are precise and do not require additional context for understanding.
#### Final judgment: Pass.


### Instruction:
Text details: Introduction to Philosophy, by George Stuart Fullerton
Note that while you have access to this information, for the sake of rewording questions, you should evaluate the question as if you could not see this.

Question: What is the meaning of this passage?
Answer: This passage means that things which think, form plans, and act on those plans, are beyond simple machines. This is evidenced by the line "Creatures that think, form plans, and _act_, are not what we call automata."

### Response:
## Reasoning and thought process:
### Question Context Validation
#### Special Term Context Check: Specifically check for use of the terms "book", "text", "passage", and "excerpt" without context about which specific thing is being discussed. The question asks about "this passage" without specifying which passage it is referring to or what book it belongs to.
#### Text and Author Specificity: The question fails to mention which passage or book is being referred to, leading to a lack of context.
#### Scope and Precision: The question asks about the meaning of a passage, which is a precise inquiry. However, when paired with a vague reference to "this passage", the question becomes too vague and broad, thus failing this step.

### Answer Context Validation:
#### Special Term Context Check: Specifically check for use of the terms "book", "text", "passage", and "excerpt" without context about which specific thing is being discussed. The answer references "this passage" without stating which passage it is talking about.
#### Specificity and Clarity: The answer states what the passage means but fails to clarify which specific passage from 'Introduction to Philosophy' by George Stuart Fullerton it is referring to.
#### Answer-Only Context Issues: The answer does not introduce new vague context that the question does not. However, both the question and answer lack necessary context.

### Critical Evaluation and Final Judgment:
#### Evaluation: Both the question and answer lack specific context, making it impossible to determine which passage from 'Introduction to Philosophy' they are referring to. The question is precise in asking for a meaning but fails due to lack of context.
#### Final judgment: Fail.

    text2 = """A substance or material is that which occupies space and has
      weight; that is, which presents a mass attracted by the earth and
      by other masses of material, and of which the _objects_ of nature
      are composed, and by means of which the motions and _phenomena_
      of nature are accomplished. It is easy to discover by examining
      and investigating, by various methods, the objects met with
      in nature and in the arts, that some of them are homogeneous,
      whilst others are composed of a mixture of several homogeneous
      substances. This is most clearly apparent in solid substances.
      The metals used in the arts (for example, gold, iron, copper)
      must be homogeneous, otherwise they are brittle and unfit for
      many purposes. Homogeneous matter exhibits similar properties in
      all its parts. By breaking up a homogeneous substance we obtain
      parts which, although different in form, resemble each other in
      their properties. Glass, pure sugar, marble, &c., are examples of
      homogeneous substances. Examples of non-homogeneous substances
      are, however, much more frequent in nature and the arts. Thus
      the majority of the rocks are not homogeneous. In porphyries
      bright pieces of a mineral called 'orthoclase' are often seen
      interspersed amongst the dark mass of the rock. In ordinary red
      granite it is easy to distinguish large pieces of orthoclase mixed
      with dark semi-transparent quartz and flexible laminæ of mica.
      Similarly, plants and animals are non-homogeneous. Thus, leaves
      are composed of a skin, fibre, pulp, sap, and a green colouring
      matter. As an example of those non-homogeneous substances which
      are produced artificially, gunpowder may be cited, which is
      prepared by mixing together known proportions of sulphur, nitre,
      and charcoal. Many liquids, also, are not homogeneous, as may be
      observed by the aid of the microscope, when drops of blood are
      seen to consist of a colourless liquid in which red corpuscles,
      invisible to the naked eye owing to their small size, are floating
      about. It is these corpuscles which give blood its peculiar
      colour. Milk is also a transparent liquid, in which microscopical
      drops of fat are floating, which rise to the top when milk is
      left at rest, forming cream. It is possible to extract from every
      non-homogeneous substance those homogeneous substances of which
      it is made up. Thus orthoclase may he separated from porphyry by
      breaking it off. So also gold is extracted from auriferous sand by
      washing away the mixture of clay and sand. Chemistry deals only
      with the homogeneous substances met with in nature, or extracted
      from natural or artificial non-homogeneous substances. The various
      mixtures found in nature form the subjects of other natural
      sciences--as geognosy, botany, zoology, anatomy, &c."""

Chemistry deals with the homogeneous substances met with in nature or extracted from natural or artificial non-homogeneous substances, so it is important to distinguish between them because it determines which parts of a given substance can be used for chemical analysis and study.'), 
        ('What is an example of an artistic mixture that would be non-homogeneous?', 'An example of a non-homogeneous artistic mixture could be gunpowder, which is prepared by mixing together known proportions of sulphur, nitre, and charcoal.'), 
        ('How might the concept of homogeneity apply to education or learning?', 'In education or learning, students can think about their own knowledge as a homogeneous substance, made up of similar concepts that resemble each other in terms of understanding. They may need to separate out these ideas from non-homogeneous ones (e.g., misconceptions) in order to fully grasp the concept and build upon it.'), 
        ('If we were told to find homogeneous substances in nature, how would we go about doing this?', 'To find homogeneous substances in nature, one could examine and investigate various objects met with in nature and in the arts. Some of these objects might be homogeneous, whilst others are composed of a mixture of several homogeneous substances. By breaking up a homogeneous substance, we would obtain parts which, although different in form, resemble each other in their properties. This suggests that we could identify homogeneous substances by looking for these characteristics. Additionally, some examples mentioned in the text include gold, iron, copper, glass, pure sugar, marble, and ordinary red granite. However, not all non-homogeneous substances are immediately apparent; it requires investigating and understanding how they are made up of different components (such as orthoclase being separated from porphyry). Therefore, a combination of observing physical properties, breaking down materials, and understanding their composition would allow us to identify homogeneous substances in nature.')]
