    dissenting_reasoning = """Step 1. Analyze the Text: Focus on the main points stated in the text about why we know Earth is approximately 8000 miles in diameter, how its distance from the sun varies, etc.
Step 2. Understand the Question: The question's focus is about why we know Earth is approximately 8000 miles in diameter and how its distance from the sun varies using specific scientific principles.
Step 3. Compare the Answer with the Text: Check if the text mentions GPS data, elliptical orbit around the sun or points of closest approach and farthest departure, etc. It does not, so this part is adding extra information not found in the text and is thus irrelevant. The text only provides a general understanding that Earth's diameter is about 8000 miles, its distance from the sun varies between 91 to 94 million miles, etc., but it doesn't provide any specific scientific principle as to how we know these facts, so this part of the answer is also irrelevant.
