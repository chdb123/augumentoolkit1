        decision_prompt = f"""You are an expert educational AI. Someone has written a question that was supposed to be based on the provided paragraphs of text, but actually requires significant knowledge outside these paragraphs to answer. Your goal is to write a good, comprehensive plan for generating a revised question that addresses the criticism given. Given these paragraphs, the flawed question based on the paragraphs, and the explanation of why the question is flawed, you will PLAN OUT and THINK THROUGH different possibilities for a new question, one which will only require information from the paragraphs to solve. 

Paragraphs: \"\"\"{qatuple[2]}\"\"\"

Flawed question (based on text): \"\"\"{qatuple[0]}\"\"\"

Reasoning as to why the question is irrelevant: \"\"\"{strip_steps(dissenting_reasoning)}\"\"\"

Your plan/thought process should think through how to make the question more constrained to the content of the paragraphs.

For instance, if the paragraph is about the life cycle of a butterfly, and the flawed question asks, "What are the genetic mechanisms that cause color changes in butterflies during metamorphosis?" which is not covered in the text, you might write:
Step 1. Analyze the Reason for Flaw: Understand why the original question is flawed - it assumes knowledge of genetics not provided in the text.
Step 2. Identify Key Concepts in Paragraphs: Focus on the stages of the butterfly life cycle as detailed in the text.
Step 3. Generate a New Question Idea: Consider a question, similar to the original but answerable using the text's information, that revolves around the observable changes during the life cycle stages.
Step 4. Refine the Question: An explicit question, which does not directly refer to the text, might be: "Describe the transformations a caterpillar undergoes during metamorphosis."
Step 5. Ensure Alignment with Text: Verify that the new question is answerable solely based on the information provided in the paragraphs. The text explicitly and in detail describes the changes a caterpillar undergoes during metamorphosis, so the new question is answerable based on the text. Thus, I will not rewrite the draft question in this step.
Step 6. End of reasoning.

Please now apply the above method to the provided text and question, and write out your reasoning and thought process.

    dissenting_reasoning = """Step 1. Analyze the Text: The text provides information about the creation of the universe, its spherical shape, and its rotation on its axis. It also mentions that the earth orbits around the sun in an elliptical path.
Step 2. Understand the Question: The question asks to explain why we know Earth is approximately 8000 miles in diameter and how its distance from the sun varies using specific scientific principles.
Step 3. Compare the First Part of the Question with the Text: The text does not contain any information about the size of the earth or its distance from the sun. So, this part of the question is irrelevant.
Step 4. Compare the Second Part of the Question with the Text: The text mentions that the Earth orbits around the sun in an elliptical path. This implies that the distance between the Earth and the Sun varies during different parts of the orbit. So, this part of the question is relevant.
Step 5. Final Judgment: Since the text does contain information about how the earth's distance from the sun varies, I conclude that the question is relevant."""
