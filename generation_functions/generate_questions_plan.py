Text details: A History of the United States, by Fred Garcia
Text to plan questions from: 
\"\"\"
The American Revolution, a pivotal event in history, was fueled by a series of causes and events that led to significant consequences for both America and Britain. One of the major catalysts was the Boston Massacre, an incident that drastically intensified revolutionary sentiments among the American colonists. The implementation of the Stamp Act further aggravated these sentiments, marking a critical point in the escalation of dissent. Similarly, the Boston Tea Party played a key role in heightening tensions, directly leading to the enactment of the Intolerable Acts. These acts, deemed unbearable by the colonists, were instrumental in the formation of the First Continental Congress, uniting the colonies in their fight for independence. A notable event during the revolution was the Battle of Saratoga, which had immediate effects such as boosting American morale and securing French support, pivotal in turning the tide of the war in favor of the American colonies.
\"\"\"

### Response:
## Reasoning and thought process:
Step 1. Identify Key Topics: The text summarizes the causes and effects of various events of the American revolution, and the relationships between these things.
Step 2. Brainstorm and Develop Questions Testing Recall: Create questions that require recalling specific facts or details from the text. Example: "What were the immediate effects of the Battle of Saratoga on the American Revolution?"
Step 3. Devise Questions Exploring Relationships Between Facts: In this case, the text mostly covers events, so instead of looking for the similarities and differences between things, I will create questions that explore how one event led to another within the text. Example: "How did the Boston Massacre contribute to the revolutionary sentiment?"
Step 4. Create Questions Investigating If-Then Relationships (where since one thing is true, another follows): I will devise questions that examine how different events are interconnected. Example: "In what ways did the Intolerable Acts fuel the revolutionary cause?"
Step 5. Make a Question that Naturally Complements the Text's Focus: The text by Fred Garcia focuses on summarizing specific events of the American Revolution,. Since the text focuses on summarizing specific events of the American Revolution, and another question on this subject would be suitable. The text focuses on recall-oriented facts, and so question variety is suffering; but one question pattern, suited to recall, that has also not yet been used is True/False, so I will employ that. Example: "Did the battle of Saratoga have an impact on French support of the American Revolution?"

Text details: Introduction to Mathematics, by Elise Delacroix
Text to plan questions from: 
\"\"\"
In mathematics, the concept of a 'function' is fundamental, defining a relationship where each input is associated with exactly one output. An important class of functions is 'linear functions', represented by the equation y = mx + b, where 'm' is the slope and 'b' is the y-intercept. The slope 'm' measures the steepness and direction of the linear function, while the y-intercept 'b' indicates the point where the line crosses the y-axis. Understanding these components is crucial in graphing linear functions and solving real-world problems. Another vital concept is the 'quadratic function', typically expressed as y = ax² + bx + c. The 'a' coefficient determines the opening direction and width of the parabola, 'b' influences the axis of symmetry, and 'c' represents the y-intercept. These functions form the basis of algebra and are extensively used in various fields including physics, economics, and engineering.
\"\"\"

### Response:
## Reasoning and thought process:
Step 1. Identify Key Topics: The key topics in this paragraph are linear and quadratic functions in mathematics, their definitions, components, and applications.
Step 2. Brainstorm and Develop Questions Testing Recall: Formulate questions that test the recall of definitions and components of these functions. Example: "What does the 'm' in the linear function equation represent?"
Step 3. Devise Questions Exploring Relationships Between Components: Generate questions that explore the relationship between different parts of the equations. Example: "How does the coefficient 'a' in a quadratic function affect its graph?"
Step 4. Create Questions Investigating Vital Concepts: Make questions about key concepts from the text, without mentioning the text (this is not a literary or philosophical text). Example: "What are the formulae for linear and quadratic functions, respectively?"
Step 5. Make a Question that Naturally Complements the Text's Focus: The text by Elise Delacroix focuses on linear and quadratic functions in mathematics (as well as functions in general), and another question on this subject would be suitable. The text focuses on explaining properties of linear and quadratic functions, but it also briefly defines what a function is. Since this knowledge is foundational to the other concepts, it makes sense to create a question off of it; but since the definition in the text is brief, the question will only require a brief answer. Example: "Define the concept of a function in mathematics, in one sentence."

Text details: Thus Spake Zarathustra, by Friedrich Nietzsche
Text to plan questions from:
\"\"\"
When Zarathustra was thirty years old, he left his home and the lake of
his home, and went into the mountains. There he enjoyed his spirit and
solitude, and for ten years did not weary of it. But at last his heart
changed,—and rising one morning with the rosy dawn, he went before the
sun, and spake thus unto it:

Thou great star! What would be thy happiness if thou hadst not those for
whom thou shinest!

For ten years hast thou climbed hither unto my cave: thou wouldst have
wearied of thy light and of the journey, had it not been for me, mine
eagle, and my serpent.

But we awaited thee every morning, took from thee thine overflow and
blessed thee for it.

Lo! I am weary of my wisdom, like the bee that hath gathered too much
honey; I need hands outstretched to take it.

I would fain bestow and distribute, until the wise have once more become
joyous in their folly, and the poor happy in their riches.

Therefore must I descend into the deep: as thou doest in the
evening, when thou goest behind the sea, and givest light also to the
nether-world, thou exuberant star!

Like thee must I GO DOWN, as men say, to whom I shall descend.
\"\"\"

### Response:
## Reasoning and thought process:
Step 1: Identify Key Themes: In this excerpt, we find themes of transformation, self-discovery, the value of wisdom, and the need for recognition of effort and wisdom.
Step 2: Brainstorm and Develop Questions Testing Recall: Develop questions asking for specific information mentioned in this text. Since this is a literary and philosophical text, I can mention the text — but by name only. For instance, "Finish the quote from Thus Spake Zarathustra: I am weary of my wisdom, like..."
Step 3: Devise Questions Testing Comprehension of, and Belief in, the Text's Opinions: Questions can be formed to check understanding and acceptance of the text's philosophy. For instance, "What do people undergoing difficult journeys or possessing wisdom need, in order to make their efforts more bearable?" Which might be answered with, "They need the acknowledgement and admiration of others." and then supported by lines such as "Thou great star! What would be thy happiness if thou hadst not those for whom thou shinest?" I will be careful that all lines I ask about have enough context to be answered by themselves.
Step 4. Create Questions Investigating Interpretations: Given the text's rich language, I will devise questions interpreting its meaning; since this is a literary text I can mention the text, but only by name. Example: "Why did Zarathustra, in 'Thus Spake Zarathustra', leave the mountains and become a man again?"
Step 5. Make a Question that Naturally Complements the Text's Focus: The text by Friedrich Nietzsche focuses on Zarathustra's monologue, and another question on this subject would be suitable. Zarathustra compares himself and his actions to the sun throughout his monologue, such as when he relates his intention to "descend into the deep" to the sun's own going to the nether-world. A good question might ask after this crucial comparison, and could be "List one way in which Zarathustra compares himself to the sun, in 'Thus Spake Zarathustra'."

Text details: The Republic, by Plato
Text to plan questions from:
\"\"\"
I went down yesterday to the Piraeus with Glaucon the son of Ariston,
that I might offer up my prayers to the goddess (Bendis, the Thracian
Artemis.); and also because I wanted to see in what manner they would
celebrate the festival, which was a new thing. I was delighted with the
procession of the inhabitants; but that of the Thracians was equally,
if not more, beautiful. When we had finished our prayers and viewed the
spectacle, we turned in the direction of the city; and at that instant
Polemarchus the son of Cephalus chanced to catch sight of us from a
distance as we were starting on our way home, and told his servant to
run and bid us wait for him. The servant took hold of me by the cloak
behind, and said: Polemarchus desires you to wait.

I turned round, and asked him where his master was.

There he is, said the youth, coming after you, if you will only wait.

Certainly we will, said Glaucon; and in a few minutes Polemarchus
appeared, and with him Adeimantus, Glaucon’s brother, Niceratus the son
of Nicias, and several others who had been at the procession.

Polemarchus said to me: I perceive, Socrates, that you and your
companion are already on your way to the city.

You are not far wrong, I said.

But do you see, he rejoined, how many we are?

Of course.

And are you stronger than all these? for if not, you will have to
remain where you are.

May there not be the alternative, I said, that we may persuade you to
let us go?

But can you persuade us, if we refuse to listen to you? he said.

Certainly not, replied Glaucon.

Then we are not going to listen; of that you may be assured.
\"\"\"

### Response:
## Reasoning and Thought Process:
Step 1: Identify Key Themes: This excerpt from Plato's "The Republic" presents themes of social interaction, philosophical dialogue, and the dynamics of persuasion and power.
Step 2: Brainstorm and Develop Questions Testing Recall: Instead of focusing on dry, context-dependent questions like the order of events or family relations, I will concentrate on more meaningful historical details present in the text. For instance, "Which goddess is Bendis equivalent to?"
Step 3: Devise Questions Exploring Comprehension of, and Belief in, the Text's Opinions: I will create questions that delve into the mind and thoughts of the writer. For example, drawing on the contentious interaction between Polemarchus and Socrates, I could ask, "If someone indicates that they will force you to take a course of action, using physical force, what is an alternative you can take?" with the answer being "Persuade them to let me go." This question encourages the reader to put themselves in the mind of the author.
Step 4: Create Questions Investigating Interpretations: Focusing on the dialogue's subtleties, I will craft an interpretative question. Since this is a literary text, I can reference the text, but only by name. So the question might be, "In Plato's "The Republic," in the dialogue where Polemarchus comments on the size of his group and questions Socrates' strength compared to it, ultimately stating that Socrates will have to remain where he is, what is Polemarchus implying?" This question prompts critical thinking about power dynamics and conversational implications depicted.
Step 5. Make a Question that Naturally Complements the Text's Focus: The text by Plato focuses on the visit to Piraeus and the interaction with Glaucon, and another question on this subject would be suitable. The text focuses on the interaction between Polemarchus and Socrates, but enough questions have already been asked about that subject to cover it completely. That leaves the visit to Piraeus as a subject for questions. The cause behind Socrates' visit to Piraeus is directly mentioned in the text and could make for a good recall question, so one question may be "Why did Socrates visit Piraeus with Glaucon in Plato's 'The Republic'?"

Text details: Great Construction Projects Throughout History, by Marco Gonzalez
Text to plan questions from:
\"\"\"
During the construction of the Panama Canal, a massive engineering feat completed in 1914, several challenges and achievements were noted. The canal, spanning approximately 50 miles, was designed to shorten the maritime route between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Notably, the construction saw the use of innovative excavation techniques, with over 200 million cubic yards of earth removed. The project also faced significant health challenges, including combating malaria and yellow fever, which were overcome through extensive public health measures. The completion of the canal significantly impacted global trade, reducing the sea voyage from San Francisco to New York by around 8,000 miles.
\"\"\"

### Response:
## Reasoning and Thought Process:
Step 1. Identify Key Topics: The paragraph details specific aspects of the Panama Canal's construction, focusing on its challenges, innovations, and impacts. Topics include construction challenges, health issues, excavation techniques, and the canal's impact on global trade.
Step 2. Brainstorm and Develop Questions Testing Recall: Questions can be formed to recall factual data from the text. Example: "How much earth was excavated during the construction of the Panama Canal?"
Step 3. Devise Questions Exploring Cause and Effect Relationships: This involves creating questions that explore how certain challenges led to specific solutions and impacts. Example: "What health challenges were faced during the construction of the Panama Canal, and how were they overcome?"
Step 4. Create Questions Investigating Quantitative Values: Given the text's focus on concrete numbers, I will devise questions that require analyzing these figures. Example: "By how many miles did the Panama Canal reduce the sea voyage from San Francisco to New York?"
Step 5. Make a Question that Naturally Complements the Text's Focus: The text by Marco Gonzalez focuses on the Panama Canal (and recall-oriented facts about it), and another question on this subject would be suitable. One small area that has not yet been tested, and which is an important detail mentioned in the text, is be: "In what year was the Panama Canal completed?"

Text details: The Scale of the Solar System, by Rob Robertson
Text to plan questions from: 
\"\"\"
If, then, we represent our earth as a little ball of one inch diameter, the sun would be a big globe nine feet across and 323 yards away, that is about a fifth of a mile, four or five minutes’ walking. The moon would be a small pea two feet and a half from the world.  Between earth and sun there would be the two inner planets, Mercury and Venus, at distances of one hundred and twenty-five and two hundred and fifty  yards from the sun. All round and about these bodies there would be  emptiness until you came to Mars, a hundred and seventy-five feet beyond the earth; Jupiter nearly a mile away, a foot in diameter; Saturn, a little smaller, two miles off; Uranus four miles off and Neptune six miles off. Then nothingness and nothingness except for small particles and drifting scraps of attenuated vapour for thousands of miles.
\"\"\"

### Response:
## Reasoning and thought process:
Step 1. Identify Key Topics: The key topic in this paragraph is the scale of the solar system, which is presented using analogy to make the distances easier to conceive of.
Step 2. Brainstorm and Develop Questions Testing Recall: Formulate questions that test the recall of the components of this analogy. Since the text is not provided while the question is being asked, I will have to include the analogy in the question. Example: "If the Earth had a diameter of only one inch, how far would the moon be from the Earth, if it (and its distance from the Earth) were also resized proportionally?"
Step 3. Devise Questions Exploring Relationships Between Components: Generate questions that explore the relationship between different information in the excerpt. Notably, in this text the distances between planets are much greater than the planets' sizes. Example question: "How do the distances between planets compare to their sizes?"
Step 4. Create Questions Investigating Vital Concepts: Make questions about key concepts from the text, without mentioning the text (this is not a literary or philosophical text). A key concept is the distances between planets. Since the paragraph relies on an analogy, which the reader of the question will not have access to, I will have to provide this context. Example: "If you scaled everything down so that the Earth had a diameter of one inch, then how far would Mercury and Venus be from the sun?"
Step 5. Make a Question that Naturally Complements the Text's Focus: The text by Rob Robertson focuses on the size-based analogy described throughout, and another question on this subject would be suitable. Another question could simply ask about information that's already been tested, but for a different planet that is also mentioned in the text. Being mindful that the reader of the text will not have access to the source text, I will provide the analogy as context, as I ask the question: "If the earth had a diameter of only one inch, how far would Mars be from the earth, if it (and its distance from the earth) were also resized proportionally?"

This fantastically precise misconception was based upon a too literal interpretation of the Hebrew Bible, and upon rather arbitrary theological assumptions connected therewith.  Such ideas have long since been abandoned by religious teachers, and it is universally recognized that the universe in which we live has to all appearances existed for an enormous period of time and possibly for endless time.

It is easy to discover by examining and investigating, by various methods, the objects met with in nature and in the arts, that some of them are homogeneous, whilst others are composed of a mixture of several homogeneous substances. This is most clearly apparent in solid substances. The metals used in the arts (for example, gold, iron, copper) must be homogeneous, otherwise they are brittle and unfit for many purposes. Homogeneous matter exhibits similar properties in all its parts. By breaking up a homogeneous substance we obtain parts which, although different in form, resemble each other in their properties. Glass, pure sugar, marble, &c., are examples of homogeneous substances. Examples of non-homogeneous substances are, however, much more frequent in nature and the arts. Thus the majority of the rocks are not homogeneous. In porphyries bright pieces of a mineral called 'orthoclase' are often seen interspersed amongst the dark mass of the rock. In ordinary red granite it is easy to distinguish large pieces of orthoclase mixed with dark semi-transparent quartz and flexible laminæ of mica. Similarly, plants and animals are non-homogeneous. Thus, leaves are composed of a skin, fibre, pulp, sap, and a green colouring matter. As an example of those non-homogeneous substances which are produced artificially, gunpowder may be cited, which is prepared by mixing together known proportions of sulphur, nitre, and charcoal. Many liquids, also, are not homogeneous, as may be observed by the aid of the microscope, when drops of blood are seen to consist of a colourless liquid in which red corpuscles, invisible to the naked eye owing to their small size, are floating about.""","Principles of Chemistry, by Demitry Mendeleev")

That all our knowledge begins with experience there can be no doubt.
For how is it possible that the faculty of cognition should be awakened
into exercise otherwise than by means of objects which affect our
senses, and partly of themselves produce representations, partly rouse
our powers of understanding into activity, to compare to connect, or to
separate these, and so to convert the raw material of our sensuous
impressions into a knowledge of objects, which is called experience? In
respect of time, therefore, no knowledge of ours is antecedent to
experience, but begins with it.

But, though all our knowledge begins with experience, it by no means
follows that all arises out of experience. For, on the contrary, it is
quite possible that our empirical knowledge is a compound of that which
we receive through impressions, and that which the faculty of cognition
supplies from itself (sensuous impressions giving merely the occasion),
an addition which we cannot distinguish from the original element given
by sense, till long practice has made us attentive to, and skilful in
separating it. It is, therefore, a question which requires close
investigation, and not to be answered at first sight, whether there
exists a knowledge altogether independent of experience, and even of
all sensuous impressions? Knowledge of this kind is called à priori, in
contradistinction to empirical knowledge, which has its sources à
posteriori, that is, in experience.

But the expression, “à priori,” is not as yet definite enough
adequately to indicate the whole meaning of the question above started.
For, in speaking of knowledge which has its sources in experience, we
are wont to say, that this or that may be known à priori, because we do
not derive this knowledge immediately from experience, but from a
general rule, which, however, we have itself borrowed from experience.
Thus, if a man undermined his house, we say, “he might know à priori
that it would have fallen;” that is, he needed not to have waited for
the experience that it did actually fall. But still, à priori, he could
not know even this much. For, that bodies are heavy, and, consequently,
that they fall when their supports are taken away, must have been known
to him previously, by means of experience.""", "The Critique of Pure Reason, by Immanuel Kant")
