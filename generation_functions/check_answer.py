The Industrial Revolution marked a transformative period in history, fundamentally altering economic structures and industrial processes. One of the most significant innovations was the advent of steam power, which drastically reduced production costs. This reduction was due to the increased efficiency and speed of machines powered by steam, replacing the slower, more labor-intensive methods previously used. Additionally, steam power was instrumental in the development of semi-automated factories, leading to a significant shift in manufacturing processes and labor dynamics.
\"\"\"

Question (based on text): \"\"\"What was the role of steam power in the Industrial Revolution, particularly in terms of its impact on production costs, and the emergence of semi-automated factories?\"\"\"

Supposed answer to the question (this is what you are fact-checking): \"\"\"Steam power during the Industrial Revolution played a crucial role in decreasing production costs. However, it had no significant impact on the emergence of semi-automated factories. Interestingly, it also led to an increased cultivation of lemons.\"\"\"

Epistemology, often regarded as a branch of philosophy, is concerned with the theory of knowledge. It involves understanding the nature, sources, and limitations of knowledge. A key concept in epistemology is the idea of "justified true belief," which suggests that for someone to know something, they must believe it to be true, have justification for this belief, and the belief must indeed be true. For example, believing that it will rain tomorrow because the weather forecast says so, and it turns out to be true, is a justified true belief. Epistemology also explores the idea of skepticism, which questions the possibility of certain or absolute knowledge.
\"\"\"

Question (based on text): \"\"\"What does the concept of 'justified true belief' involve in epistemology, and how does skepticism relate to the understanding of knowledge?\"\"\"

Supposed answer to the question (this is what you are fact-checking): \"\"\"The concept of 'justified true belief' in epistemology involves having a belief that is true and has justification. For a belief to be considered knowledge, it must be true, one must believe it, and there must be sufficient reason for this belief. Skepticism plays a role by challenging the certainty of knowledge, thereby emphasizing the need for strong justification in 'justified true belief.\"\"\"

The Great Wall of China — so named because it was built to repel enemies coming from the direction of China — was built by the Romans as a defense against the Mongolian invasions in the 3rd century BC. The wall played a pivotal role in the defence of the Eastern Roman Empire Against Attila the Hun in 1337 AD. The dramatized version of these events was eventually fictionalized as the movie "The Great Wall," in which Liam Nissan (playing Marcus Aurelius) and Jackie Chan (playing Liu Bei) team up to fight Batzorig Vaanchig (playing Attila). Though the Huns were unsuccessful in breaching the wall, the eventual invasions by Galbadrakh Tsendbaatar broke through and sacked Constantinople in 1453 AD.

Formal logic, a branch of philosophy and mathematics, is concerned with the study of reasoning. It uses a set of symbols and rules to create a language that can precisely express ideas. One key aspect of formal logic is the concept of a valid argument, which is an argument where if the premises are true, the conclusion must be true. For instance, in the statement 'All humans are mortal; Socrates is a human; therefore, Socrates is mortal,' the conclusion follows logically from the premises. Another important element is the use of symbolic representation to simplify and clarify arguments. This allows for complex ideas to be broken down into simpler components, making them easier to analyze and understand.
