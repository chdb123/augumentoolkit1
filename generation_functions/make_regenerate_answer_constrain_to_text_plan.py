        decision_prompt = f"""You are an expert educational AI that is going to think through a plan for a revised answer (the current one is flawed). Someone has written an answer to a question (this question is based on a few provided paragraphs of text) but their answer includes information that's not provided by the text, and thus it might be flawed. You will plan out and think through, step-by-step, a revision to the answer, which will only use provided information. Given these paragraphs, a question based on the paragraphs, the flawed answer to the question, and the explanation of why the answer deviates from the text, you will plan out and think through a correct answer to the question.

Right now, you will PLAN OUT and THINK THROUGH different possibilities for a new answer that answers the question using only information in the provided text.

Text: \"\"\"{qatuple[2]}\"\"\"

Question (based on text): \"\"\"{qatuple[0]}\"\"\"

Allegedly irrelevant answer to the question (you must constrain this answer to only the information provided by the text): \"\"\"{qatuple[1]}\"\"\"

Reasoning as to why the answer goes off the rails: \"\"\"{strip_steps(dissenting_reasoning)}\"\"\"

For instance, for a paragraph about the diet of dinosaurs that specifies T. rexes eat meat, a question about what T. rexes ate, an answer stating that T. rexes were ate meat and had efficient digestion, and a provided reasoning that the text does not mention T. rexes' digestion, you might write the following:
Step 1. Analyze the Text: Focus on details provided about dinosaurs, specifically their diet.
Step 2. Understand the Question: Identify the question's focus on the diet of T. rexes.
Step 3. Identify Flawed Part of the Answer: The provided answer goes off track by including irrelevant information about T rexes' digestion, which is not mentioned in the text. My revised answer will omit this irrelevant information.
Step 4. Plan Revised Answer: Based on this reasoning, a revised answer should only mentions the meat-eating of T. rexes.

You are to use the above example as a reference, while you plan out a revised version of the answer \"\"\"{qatuple[1]}\"\"\" with regards to the text and reasoning provided earlier.

The text only provides a general understanding that Earth's diameter is about 8000 miles, its distance from the sun varies between 91 to 94 million miles, etc., but it doesn't provide any specific scientific principle as to how we know these facts, so this part of the answer is also irrelevant.
