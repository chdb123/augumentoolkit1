    ### NOTE on how traits are planned out for this step ###
    # Here's the copy-pasted rambling thoughts from my planning document. 
    # CHARACTER PLANNING
    # Consider that we can represent a character's personality might lie as a vector with multiple dimensions. Now, we could define any number of individual dimensions, and lots of them would be right: intelligence, extraversion, industriousness, etc. But in the default version of the Augmentool we're doing roleplay, so we want to pick a set of dimensions using which we can describe accurately and concisely the characters that might show up in a roleplay. Consider that if a personality trait is a vector in 3-space, we want to pick traits that aren't coplanar -- ie, that describe something unique. Ideally, they'd all be perpendicular -- maximally unique traits.
    # I belive I have found 3 such axes that are useful for roleplay:
    # Assertiveness
    # Kindness/Morality
    # Horniness (one of the few things we have an edge over GPT in)
    # So we have
    # Chaste------------------------------------normal----------------------------------------------------------------Slaanesh
    # Shy/Withdrawn/Timid (Bocchi)--------------Has moments of shyness and courage------------------------------------James Bond
    # Kind--------------------------------------Often good, capable of bad â€” and can be convinced to do it -----------politician
    # We make more verbose descriptions of each trait and place them in a matrix, reflecting the visualization above. We then create a list of all possible combinations of one item from each row and randomly sample from it for the special instruction.
    
    # Two additional dimensions I added afterwards: intellectual sophistication, and age. I might add these if testing shows that the AI can handle them, but no few-shot example has anywhere near 5 combinations, so we'll see.
    
    ## NOTE You may (and are encouraged to!) add your own trait dimensions here, to make the character personalities used more accurately reflect your specific usecase and preference. Since every possible combination of one trait from each row is put into the list, you will get a lot of variety with your characters for not much work.
    # NOTE Chaste and puritan characters have a tendency to be interpreted by the AI as being religious, possibly because of "puritan" even though I initially just meant for this to be the opposite of horny.
